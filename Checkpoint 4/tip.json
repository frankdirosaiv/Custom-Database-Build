{"text":"Extremely poor management and lack of expectations for guest experience. \n\nSeveral tables were not bussed and guests were told to seat themselves (at dirty tables). Even with new guests at tables, the three waitresses did not clean the tables with any sense of urgency nor did they acknowledge the guests. \n\nI would not recommend this to any family or friends.","date":"2016-03-02","likes":0,"business_id":"-yeIdDaCHwXnWfjoGQNYoQ","user_id":"Ba6M8whp-iff5KQyxMkOoA","type":"tip"}
