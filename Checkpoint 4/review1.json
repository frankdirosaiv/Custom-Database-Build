When we got there (just after 7pm) we were the only people there.  Paper place mats, folded paper menus, not necessarily the cleanest cutlery I've ever seen.  Service was poor.  The waitress didn't know the menu AT ALL, and was not so attentive.\n\nNot the best prices, either.  $4 for veggie pakora appetizers, $10.50 for my channa masala and $11 for his chicken tikka masala, $3.50 for naan to share.\n\nThe food was pretty awesome.  The pakoras were delicious, and there was a big plate of them.  The chutneys were really good as well.  The entrees were spicy, but not overwhelming.  Very tasty!!  The rice was perfectly cooked, which makes such a big difference.  The garlic naan was definitely the stand-out dish.  Buttery and very garlicky and had a great texture to it.  I would go back and eat just that any time.  \n\nI probably won't come back here, although it was decent.  Still not exactly what I'm looking for.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Two rows of food with an additional row containing some yogurt rice, watermelon, sauces\/dressings and some meh looking fruit pudding.. Needless to say I kept focused on the main two rows.\n\n  As I feasted on several platefuls of delicious goat roganjosh, spicy 'chicken 65' - sometimes with the butter chicken sauce on top, and some excellent chicken tandoori I was pleased to notice several large Indian families come in to eat - aaalways a good sign. Some more highlights include their great egg curry with glazed onions and mango dahl... \n\n  The recipes carry an authenticity to them... 4\/5 stars - Recommended for anyone in the area looking to get some Indian food for lunch. Would give a fifth star for a more competitive price (little high on weekends at $13+ per adult), a slighttlyyy bigger selection, and dinner buffet availability... (All of which can be found at the Indian Oven in Northeast Mesa.) But overall a good bet for lunch in SW Chandler.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

They change their items on the buffet each time, they told me.  \n\nMy kids like the Tandoori chicken. They have melons\/fruits for dessert, too, so the kids like that, as well. And the naan--well, the naan--what can you say about naan? mmmmmm. Naan is a type of Indian bread, in case you've not had it. and it's fantastic here. Waaay too much carbs when you eat here!!  \n\nI asked about the samosas--I have never been able to find small samosas since living in the middle east where they had Indians and Pakistanis on the streets with carts selling samosas (the small ones). I finally asked, and the guy told me they are a specialty item and hard to get. The big ones are easy to get. I don't care for the big ones.\n\nThe downfall to this place--the service isn't the best here. If you order water, they don't keep your glass full, and sometimes it tastes bad and you have to ask for a fresh glass of water. AND, they never know how much the kids are supposed to cost for the buffet. There's no sign for prices,and when you ask, you get a different answer each time!  A few times they didn't charge us for the 1-yr olds' buffet, and the last time we went, we were charged for both kids. I said, I thought he was free (indicating my 1yr old) and the kid serving us got the manager, who was an American female (no Indians to be found manning the floor) and she said there was a charge for each person's meal. Since they are so confused and can't be bothered to give menus or post the prices and ages, we probably won't go back often.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Its quite a large, sprawling bar which is nice enough. As the name suggests it is an Irish bar and popular with the many Irish in Edinburgh.

I like the quirky little barrels for tables and such like.\n\nMy poor friend and I had been in a cheap little bar on the Cowgate where it was a pound a drink (my round, score!).

It is to be found at the end of a side road just after the end of the bridge above your head.  This entry road alone conjures up a spectacular atmosphere - it's almost like the movies where the best clubs are down some shady side street.  This street itself is perfectly safe, but it does do its job in creating a fabulous mood - all it lacks is a haze of mist for you to navigate through on your way to the door.\n\nOnce inside the first thing you'll notice is a vast amount of sporting memorabilia - mostly Irish with a few exception such as a Sunderland shirt above the bar - perhaps donated by Anthony Stokes, but who knows how this shirt came to end up in this collection.  Thanks to its location this pub has managed to maintain a high proportion of Irish patrons and the atmosphere remains distinctly Irish.  Add to this the occasional live music and along with Malones you have one of the best Irish pubs in Edinburgh.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Prices vary depending on flavor.\n\nThey have a discount if you buy 2 bags, the 3rd is free.\n\nThe other slight drawback is the fact that this Montreal location does not take part in special \"flavor of the month\" featured on their official Facebook page. Other locations across Canada offer new, experimental flavors like \"Mac and cheese\" although when I inquired about it, staff was unaware.\n\nStill very recommended, Kernels is far superior to movie theater popcorn, store bought stuff or anything you make at home.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Now I know that I was one of them! La Lingerie is an appointment-only boutique (although there are open house times as well), specifically designed to provide thorough and educational bra fittings as well as browsing time. She made me immediately comfortable -- particularly important in a business like this, because lingerie fittings are very personal. I never felt rushed or exposed, and Katherine spent a lot of time talking with me about what kinds of items would be most useful for me, then making suggestions.\n\nEverything I bought (both that day and by special order -- and yes, she will both ship and file a wishlist for later purchases -- thank goodness, since I just moved out of state!) has been terrific. I haven't noticed any weak spots or wear and tear, and I am so much more comfortable in a bra that fits well.\n\nI'm usually pretty thrifty, and honestly never would have even considered La Lingerie if my husband hadn't treated me to a gift certificate for my birthday. The shop asks that you put $100 down to make an initial fitting appointment, and you should be aware that you are likely to spend at least that much. I considered rating a star down solely for expense, but decided that this experience (and education) was truly worth it! If you've spent years looking for a bra that fits, go see Katherine. Really.","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I'd rather \"buy local\" from a small shop than go to the mall anyways, so I was hoping they'd be ok with me trying on a million pairs to find the right size (I have a hard time finding shoes that fit). They were TERRIFIC! Making sure I left happy was #1 for them, and at no time did I feel like the goal was pushing a sale out the door. My new boots fit great - exactly the right size for me (thanks to several insole tries and various sock weights). I'm wearing my new shoes now - I love them. Plus, I'm always wary of smaller shops charging more or not being as competitive with their pricing; not true. My boots were 10% less than at Soft Moc.

Enter Enzo - I've no idea what their background is, but given that there's one Pizza Pizza down the street, two Pizzaiolos within a 5 min walk, and North Of Brooklyn (their direct competitor) immediately around the corner... let's just say it's a bold move.\n\nOn my way to pick up pizza for the team at NoBo, I dashed in to grab some from Enzo for a direct comparison.\n\nI ordered both the Francesco (mushroom, mozz, olives, sausage, artichokes, roasted red) and Pepe (calabrese pepper, pepperoni, onion, olives). Flavour-wise, they sorta tasted the same, though I want to say I liked Pepe better. Both were decent picks, though I don't have a lot of recall on them - I was distracted by work. I'd probably give both a go again some time to check. Co-workers voiced that they liked North Of Brooklyn better (we also had NoBo's Margh and Puttanesca the same day).\n\nBut *I* clearly liked Enzo enough to return.\n\nSo, I had the Enza (buffalo mozz, fresh basil) today for lunch and really liked this one. The basil was nice and aromatic, the buffalo mozz was fresh and faintly buttery. Photo: https:\/\/twitter.com\/foodpr0n\/status\/328945872253640704\/photo\/1\n\nThe crust: I like. On the thick side of thin and with good chew (more chewy than I think many people may like). The bake is just-toasty, and no significant charred bits. Gives it a nice (and even), crispy, outer shell. Taste of the dough is faintly sweet.\n\nOverall, I like it. I feel the ingredients are good, the dough is tasty, and the cost is moderate (well, on the upper edges of that). Wasn't revelatory as that first bite of Libretto pizza years ago, but it's a good pie. Worth a try if you're in the area.","useful":12,"funny":0,"cool":8,"type":"review"}

I don't usually like to shop at the kiosk location of any store because I feel like it's too much one-on-one personalized attention, and I assume that their inventory is not as extensive as in the regular store.

I stopped in for lunch and ordered 2 slices (one with pepperoni and olives the other with mushrooms and sausage) and a side salad. Both slices were a nice size, however, the way they were served created an awkward eating situation. Rather than topping two individual slices they topped half of a 4 cut pizza to match my order. The slices were also an odd shape, essentially they were the chode of the pizza world (wider than they were long). This made it nearly impossible to pick them up and eat them by hand without getting sauce from ear to ear. They also violated my number 1 pizza sin and overloaded the slices with cheese. This made for a doughy center were the crust was slightly undercooked. \n\nTheir over loading of the cheese didn't stop at the pizza. My side salad came topped with an honest cup and a half of mozerella cheese. Underneath the white blanket there was a huge handful of red onion, a tomatoe slice, and some bland iceburg. On a positive note, they do make a great homemade vinegarette.\n\nEach day of the week they have a $3 lunch special.

We've both been members of Las Vegas Athletic Club for a good number of years now, so it was a tough decision to join Snap. \n\nSnap is not considered a competitor of the usual suspects like 24 Hour, Golds Gym, or LVAC. They're a small chain with more modest amenities. But because of that, they are a LOT less crowded which equates to not having to wait for equipment. The gentleman who signed us up gave us a deal that actually made it as cheap as LVAC (which is arguably the cheapest in town). \n\nOne big draw for us was that Snap is conveniently located across the street from us at work. They have more locations in the Las Vegas area, though usually located on the edges of town. They have locations across the country, also, and your membership works at any of these locations. \n\nThe other big factor was that the gentleman said we can hit pads\/focus mits there, as we both train in Muay Thai. Other gyms would not allow this as they're normally too crowded. \n\nThe only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is that the facility does not have a shower or even a changing room. They do have bathrooms and cubbies to store your belongings in, though. \n\nFor those of you who want a no-frills place to work out and not have to wait for gym equipment, I highly recommend Snap Fitness.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I brought a bunch of different photos of what I wanted and she somehow managed to take my two favorites and mesh them together into one great haircut. I thought I would feel sad after all my hair was gone. I DIDN'T. Not even a little bit. I was too excited by how great it was. And I still love the cut as its starting to grow out. \nSo, in the end, I highly recommend Kyra, she is excellent and I am sure I'll be back.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I brought a picture and she gave me the *exact* cut I requested. She has a very graceful encouraging presence-- she put me at ease right away. It's lovely to have a haircut in a private studio. Kyra's also really knows what she's doing-- I learned a bunch of new things about my hair from her that have made it easier to work with. I love the cut she gave me.

I did a google search to find indoor walking tracks and immediately came upon the Downtown Recreation Center. My parents and sister who have lived here for quite some time had never heard of it and thought I might be mistaken. Luckily, I found out I was quite right.\n\nLocated in downtown Henderson is a fairly new recreation center open to the residents. To use the track alone is $2 a year. Yep, hold yourself back from that steep price. I thought I would start there. So here are the rundowns...\n\nParking - Tons. You can either park in the lot coming off of Basic or off of Van Wagonen. \n\nLocation - Downtown with little traffic. Super easy to get in and out of quickly.\n\nAmenities - [Downstairs] Basketball court, hangout area for kids, racquetball court, women's and men's restrooms with showers, saunas, and steam rooms. \n[Upstairs] Walking\/Running track. Workout equipment on either end with hand weights and tv's. \n\nWhile I know that private gyms can be more equipped and fancier, I have to give this little gym a lot of props. It's got a good variety of equipment, not overly known so isn't always super busy, and the price is more than reasonable ($15\/month). It's also part of the greater Henderson system so you can enjoy classes and other facilities. \n\nIf you live in the area, I definitely recommend checking out this rec center.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

I'd probably keel over dead if someone ever came up and said \"Can I help you?\"  Usually I hear them giving long droning comments about stuff to customers who have no clue what they are talking about. \n\n\nI needed two things in the store.\n\nOne was easy, one was a little tougher.\n\nLets' start with the tough  item.  A USB cable.  USB Mini to USB Micro.  Not the standard cable.  The shelf had lots of items but I couldn't find it.  \n\nI managed to step in front of  an employee who was desperately trying to avoid eye contact.\n\nThe employee glanced at the wall for what could have been 2 seconds \"Well, you will just have to look for it.\"  Thank you Captain Obvious, all this time I was just admiring the wallpaper.  I told them I can't locate it.    Then they said \"Maybe we have some in the back.\"  This was his opportunity to vanish. \n\nAfter a while of waiting I gave up... cornered another employee like a scared cat trying to avoid me.\n\nThe easy item - I needed an Android tablet for one purpose and one purpose only - but not all android tablets can do what I needed -  so I asked what the return policy is.  14 days.  Good. \n\nI asked  for the cheapest android tablet they had - $139.    They were trying to talk me into the $200 samsung.  No thanks..\n\nSorry buddy, I just want the least expensive one.    Again he refers to the more expensive Samsung.  \n\nI don't want the Samsung, I just need any android tablet with a display and I want the least expensive one.  \n\nHe says Sorry we are out of those, but we have one for $149.\n\nHmmm... sounds like bait and switch (which I mention to him)  but I'll take the $149.    \n\nHe spends 10 minutes talking about why I should buy the extended warranty plan.  No thanks. I just want the tablet.  He went on and on about the quality of the tablet. Wow, what a salesman telling me what crap you sell.  Just for laughs I ask him how much the extended warranty is.  $50 for a 2 year warranty (product already has 12 month warranty).  Basically its $50 to replace it between year 1 and 2.  I ask him if he really thinks the odds of this product breaking is 1 in 3 since it is 1\/3 of the price. Again he goes on and on about the low quality.  Since he seems to be ignoring my refusal I the warranty,  I have to get angry and tell him I don't want the warranty, just get me the tablet. \n\nHe disappears and tells me it's the last one.  Whatever.  I'll take it.  He explains no returns on this.  Final sale.  And then he tries to push the $200 one he was pushing in the first place. \n\nThat was it. I was done.  On my way out I saw the employee who was \"looking in the back\" for a USB cable talking with another customer.\n\nI went to Staples - right next door - and had someone offer to help as soon as I came in.  They brought me to someone who knew about tablets right away and I left with one.\n\nI also waved goodbye to Tiger Direct for good. \n\nTiger Direct - 1) Learn about customer service. When a customer walks in say \"Can I help you?\"  When you are busy with a customer acknowledge the fact that there is another customer waiting.  MAKE EYE CONTACT!!!  Hire staff who know about the products AND know how to treat customers.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

One guy actually walked by and I said \"can you just grab that jump drive for me?\", he tells me \"I'm busy with a customer\" and keeps walking.  Seriously, it would have taken 3 seconds for this arrogant jerk just to stop, pick up the drive and hand it to me.  Some of the worst customer service I've ever seen.  After 10 minutes I had to politely interrupt a guy having a painful discussion with another customer to just grab the drive for me...to his credit he did it with a smile.

Talk about kind of obscure location never mind the fact looking from the outside never think much of recreational center. The place does\/t scream fitness more less where the swimming pool? The entire outside of the building looks more like office building space not lot of windows on the outside and just odd. Since first time actually wound up going into the wrong side of the building (no clear signage outside tells you where is what other then the two tennis courts and the building itself). The gentlemen was nice guy very friendly and directed us in the right direction. \n\nIf you plan on swimming here make SURE you go around the outside of the building toward the tennis courts.

Nice break compare to swimming laps indoor for all the swimmer you know what am talking about....Unfortunately not lot of lanes. Six in all. So its sink or swim get lane more less one by yourself. Thankfully one open up. My beast partner and I got to share lane get our training in. Lot of lifeguard support two of them. The locker rooms not sure never used them. Another section right next to the lap lanes with diving pool area and I believe cool down or kid pool area. The entree fee is the same as any other City of Henderson. The times those always vary from fall, spring, and the safe bet call ahead of time. \n\nEveryone that crossed paths with is super friendly and one of the lifeguards once done with our workout. Talking stories with was even cheering on only one guy swimming at the time. I thought nothing better if need that extra boast of positive energy hear the lifeguard cheer you on then silent treatment. Lol!!\n\nI would come here more often just for the outdoor part but Multi Gen has more lanes and set up better. It on the opposite side of town for me.

Na, ob die RealitÃ¤t wohl hÃ¤lt was die Homepage verspricht?\n \nAls wir das Restaurant an einer Strassenecke erreichten luden uns noch viele freie GartenmÃ¶bel aus Metall mit Sitzkissen und GrÃ¼nzeug auf dem Tisch an dem schÃ¶nen Sommerabend zum verweilen an der ruhigen Strasse ein (im Laufe des Abends sass es sich aber ziemlich hart und unbequem). FÃ¼r GÃ¤ste die nach 1930 Uhr kamen war es nicht mehr mÃ¶glich einen Tisch im freien zu bekommen, sie beschlossen teilweise sogar drinnen zu warten. Das Publikum bestand Ã¼berwiegend eher aus anspruchsvollerem Klientel von Anfang dreiÃig bis Ende vierzig. Mich zog es erstmal auf die neu renovierte blitz-blanke Toilette in der man vom Laminatboden hÃ¤tte Essen kÃ¶nnen. Der SpeiÃerraum Innen wirkte einigermaÃen ansprechend, MÃ¶bel in dunkelbraunem Holz (erinnerte mich irgendwie an ein Ikeamodell), angenehme Beleuchtung, das Logo des Restaurants an der Wand, ebenfalls super-sauber und frisch renoviert. Wieder drauÃen angekommen hatten meine Begleiterinnen bereits die Karte von der Bedienung gereicht bekommen und erfahren das Roastbeef und Gazpacho Tagesgerichte sind. Eine Karte fÃ¼r mich kam gleich nach, die zwei hÃ¶flichen Bedienungen wechselten sich im Verlauf an unserem Tisch ab.\nWir bestellten als Vorspeisen Tomatensuppe, die Gazpacho und mariniertes GemÃ¼se mit SternschnuppenkÃ¤se und Coppa und Salami. Als Hauptgerichte entschieden wir uns fÃ¼r das Roastbeef, die AlbGoldnudeln und Maultaschen mit Kartoffelsalat und Zwiebelschmelze. Dazu eine Flasche Wasser und einen WeiÃburgunder mit Chardonnay von Salway, die GetrÃ¤nke wurden unmgehend gebracht, der Wein kam mit guter Temperatur im KÃ¼hler.\n \nAnschlieÃend gab es als amuse bouche Rote-Beete-Zitronen-Aufstrich mit ein paar Linsen on top und Brot vom BÃ¤cker Bosch (wurde extra so angesagt, der liegt um die Ecke). Der Aufstrich war nichts besonderes, aber okay, das Brot frisch und lecker (eben wie vom guten BÃ¤cker).\n \nDie Vorspeisen kamen zÃ¼gig. In der wirklich noch unverfÃ¤lscht nach Tomaten schmeckenden Suppe fand sich ein groÃer Kleckser Basilikumpesto, schmackhaft aber kein Knaller. Gazpacho gut und fein gewÃ¼rzt, super fÃ¼r den schwÃ¼len Abend. Die Platte mit dem marinierten GemÃ¼se, SternschnuppenkÃ¤se und Coppa und Salami kam wieder mit Brot vom BÃ¤cker Bosch und frischem GrÃ¼nzeug on top, schÃ¶n angerichtet. Eigentlich handelte es sich von der Menge eher um ein Hauptgericht, alle Produkte frisch und schmackhaft, besonders das wÃ¼rzige GemÃ¼se, eigentlich war ich dann schon satt.\n \nDie Hauptgerichte lieÃen ziemlich lange (schÃ¤tze so dreiÃig Minuten) auf sich warten, immer wieder lief der Service mit Gerichten fÃ¼r Andere GÃ¤ste an unseren Tischen vorbei, die GetrÃ¤nke gingen uns so langsam aus, vovon die geschÃ¤ftigen Bedienungen relativ lange keine Notiz nahmen bis das Essen schlieÃlich fÃ¼r alle gleichzeitig kam. Aus der FÃ¼llung der etwas ungewÃ¶hnlich geformten Maultaschen lÃ¤chelte mich frischer Spinat an, der Kartoffelsalat war warm. Leider alles ein bisschen fad, aber mit Pfeffer nachgewÃ¼rzt und Zwiebelschmelze auf der jeder Gabel schmeckte es dann doch okay. Das Rostbeef mit RÃ¶staroma war gut, aber auch nicht mehr. Die AlbGoldnudeln dagegen sowohl optisch mit dem bunten GemÃ¼se schÃ¶n anzusehen als auch geschmacklich ein leckeres, wunderbar leichtes Gericht, genau das Richtige fÃ¼r einen warmen Sommerabend.\n \nDanach waren wir doch ein ziemlich pappsatt und ich war der Einzige der auf Empfehlung der Bedienung noch die StachelbeergrÃ¼tze mit Vanilleeis probierte. Es lohnte sich, die GrÃ¼tzenmasse war zwar einen Tick zu sÃ¼ss fÃ¼r meinen Geschmack, schmeckte aber mit den fruchtig-frischen StachelbeerstÃ¼ckchen und dem feinen selbstgemachten Vanilleeis zusammen wunderbar.\n \nFazit: Ein gutes Restaurant, das Ã¼berwiegend hÃ¤lt was es verspricht und eine weitere echte Option in der breit gefÃ¤cherten Restaurantszene der Weststadt die sich sicherlich halten wird. Auch um nur eine Kleinigkeit zu sich zu nehmen und ein Glas Wein zu trinken einen Besuch wert.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Wir hatten reserviert (sollte man auch) und kamen um acht in ein volles Restaurant mit zwei groÃen Gesellschaften. Es dauerte daher, bis wir uns bemerkbar machen konnten, dann wurden wir aber freundlich begrÃ¼Ãt und an unseren Tisch gefÃ¼hrt, der sich zwar am Eingang, aber doch eher am Rande des Geschehens befand. Auch mit Speisekarten wurden wir versorgt.\nÂ \nTrotzdem stÃ¶hnten wir innerlich leise. GroÃe Gesellschaften sind in der Regel ebenso laut wie lÃ¤stig, wenn man nicht selbst dazugehÃ¶rt. An diesem Abend stimmten sie mich allerdings versÃ¶hnlich, denn sie waren keines von beidem. Nur der Service war ein biÃchen Ã¼berlastet, deshalb gab es einige Wartezeit bis zur Aufnahme der Bestellung.\nÂ \nAber egal, wir hatten Hunger und orderten. Zum ersten Mal in meinem Leben war ich mit dem Problem konfrontiert, daÃ das, was mich auf der Karte interessiert hÃ¤tte, fast komplett auch entweder noch oder bald schon wieder in unserem KÃ¼hlschrank zu finden war und ich mich deshalb ein biÃchen schwertat, aber das ist nun eher ein Luxusproblem, ich gebe zu, ich habe mich in den letzten Wochen ein biÃchen an Spargel jeglicher Couleur Ã¼berfressen., auch der BÃ¤rlauch kam nicht zu kurz und nun ja, Saiblinge werden von meinem GÃ¶ttergatten Ã¶fter eingefordert als unbedingt nÃ¶tig. Nichts gegen Saiblinge, aber unter meinen Favoriten sind sie nur sehr gute B-Promis. Ich geb's zu, Seefische haben bei mir die Nase vorn. Aber leider liegt Stuttgart halt nicht am Meer.\nÂ \nEgal. Der Rieslingsekt (0,1l fÃ¼r â¬ 4,50) wird mit Brot und Buttermilchcreme schnell gebracht. Alles ist gut (besonders das Brot vom BÃ¤cker Bosch).\nÂ \nDanach kommt der Sauvignon Blanc (â¬ 6,50 fÃ¼r 0,2l) und Cabernet Dorsa (â¬ 6,20 ebenso), auch hier ist die Wartezeit ok, dann - hurra - Forellenmousse (â¬ 12,80) und gratinierter BÃ¼ffelkÃ¤se von der Hohensteiner HofkÃ¤serei, die wir sehr schÃ¤tzen (â¬ 12,30), beides mit identischem Salat. Der ist gut: Mischsalat, Petersilie, Rucola, Gurke, Tomate, PaprikawÃ¼rfel, Radieschen, Alb-Leisa. Mir ist es ein biÃchen zu viel Dressing, meinem Mann nicht, und ich kassiere verbale Watschen, als ich grinsend orakele, daÃ der Schwabe schon gern eher feucht iÃt...\nÂ \nBei der Forellenmousse finden sich auÃerdem zwei fluffige BlÃ¤tterteigstÃ¤bchen, beim BÃ¼ffel zwei dÃ¼nne Scheibchen krosses Brot (Richtung Zwieback - Crouton). Â Insgesamt wirklich gut.\nÂ \nDanach wird allerdings treudeutsch Brot und Brotteller abgerÃ¤umt. Mit dieser Ã¼berkommenen Sitte werde ich mich in diesem Leben nicht mehr anfreunden, aber ich bin ja nicht hier, um mich aufzuregen, und mir auÃerdem sicher, daÃ auf Wunsch weiteres Brot herausgerÃ¼ckt wÃ¼rde. Was sich spÃ¤ter auch bestÃ¤tigt.\nÂ \nDie folgende Pause ist wiederum ok, dann kommen die HauptgÃ¤nge. FÃ¼r mich, die ich die Vorspeisen das Beste vom Essen finde, dann auch der BÃ¼ffelkÃ¤se mit wieder identischem Salat, fÃ¼r meinen Mann Zwiebelrostbraten medium-rare mit Trollingersauce und SpÃ¤tzle. (â¬ 22,10).Â  Der angeschmolzene BÃ¼ffel ist super und ich proste Helmut Rauscher mit 0,1l Essentiell weiÃ (â¬ 3) von der Tageskarte zu. Nochmal der gleiche Salat ist nicht der BrÃ¼ller, aber ob der Bestellung meine eigene Schuld. Bei meinem Mann ist das Bild auch nicht schlecht: Ich finde, die SpÃ¤tzle haben ein biÃchen wenig BiÃ (ich schrecke aber selber auchÂ  nicht davor zurÃ¼ck, ihnen etwas HartweizengrieÃ unterzujubeln, also bin ich bei Traditionalisten eh disqualifiziert), sind aber offensichtlich handgeschabt, Das Albrind ist wirklich medium-rare, die Sauce gut.\nÂ \nInsomma, auch nach dem zweiten Besuch bleibt es beim ersten Eindruck, die RÃ¤umlichkeiten finde ich so lala, es ist relativ laut und die minimalistische Deko gefÃ¤llt mir nicht, aber es ist stimmig durchgestylt. Aufgrund der TischnÃ¤he wÃ¼rde ich vom romantischen Abend abraten, aber zum Essen mit Freunden oder erprobten Lebens- oder Kampfgenossen bietet es sich an. Die Toiletten Â sind toll und neu, StoffhandtÃ¼cher hÃ¤tte ich bei den Preisen nicht erwartet. Der Service ist aufmerksam am Wirbeln, arbeitet aber an den Grenzen der KapazitÃ¤t.\nÂ \nEin persÃ¶nliches Kuriosum: Beim Zahlen bekommen wir hinterher noch JÃ¤germeister auf Eis aufs Haus - fÃ¼r mich das erste Mal, und ich stelle fest, da hab ich nichts verpaÃt.\nÂ \nÂ \nBedienung\nBei dem absolut vollen Lokal hielten sie sich tapfer und besonders ungeheuer freundlich. Und war auch wirklich kompetent, hier konnten Fragen beantwortet werden. Also endlich mal nicht nur ServiermÃ¤use.\nDas Essen\nDer Anspruch stimmt - frisch, regional, typisch. Beim Rostbraten hat man Â nicht noch ein GemÃ¼se zwischen das Fleisch und die SpÃ¤tzle gequÃ¤lt, das ist dieser Tage ja schon mutig. Viele GÃ¤ste waren mit dem Klassiker Linsen-Saiten-SpÃ¤tz...","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Even with a wedge in your hand, you are looking to land the ball short of the putting surface if you want to wind up putting.\n\nIt is also one of the most dangerous courses I've played. I've never heard \"fore!\" yelled so much on a course before. A lot of the holes run parallel to each other, and tee-boxes are perilously close to greens on some holes. It's definitely a place you want to stay on your toes, and maybe even throw a hard hat in your golf bag.\n\nAll that being said, one of my best moments on a golf course occurred at Sunset Hills earlier this summer. \nMy friend Dave and I were out there one Wednesday afternoon, trying to get in a late 18. It was crowded, and we were waiting on the 2nd tee box when the twosome playing behind us asked if they could join us. \n\nWe said yes, and as they introduced themselves, I found myself looking up at James Worthy, all 6'7\" of him. UNC star and '82 Final Four MVP James Worthy, 3-time NBA Champion and former Laker James Worthy, recently voted one of the top 50 NBA players of all time. I almost fell down.\n\nWorthy just happened to be in town to support of an upcoming golf tournament benefitting the Boys & Girls Club of Gastonia, his hometown, and his friend dragged him over to Sunset for a few holes.\n\nThey only stayed for the front nine, but we had a good time chatting it up between holes. Perhaps most importantly, he was a personable and gracious guy, which is what you hope for out of all your sports heroes.\n\nAs Carolina basketball fans, it was a great moment for Dave and I. As a result, Sunset Hills has become a special place to me. \n\nNot the purest or best maintained course, but for a quick, inexpensive round, you could do worse. \n\nAnd plus, you never know who you might see out there","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":5,"type":"review"}

Do this: take them on a drive past Hanini Subs on Bellaire and say, \"I'll bet you lunch plus two tickets to a Tribe game that that little place right there, yeah, that one, has maybe the best corned beef you've ever had. You in?\" \n\nYou can ignore their laughter, their scorn, their righteous ridicule, and you know why? Because pigs can fly, Skippy, they can actually freaking fly. Just pull in that lot, walk in the door, order to go (can't eat in), make that short drive to that little baseball park area where West Blvd meets Clinton, and ready yourself to enjoy nirvana with rye bread and mustard. \n\nThose of you bored eough to read my reviews know I've sort of been on a West Side corned beef quest. The winner to this point is Tal's Deli on Ridge. While it may take at least another visit or two for confirmation, there may be a new champ. And, I swear, if I taste better West of the Croked River my head might explode. \n\nI read the two reviews, got a a friendly reminder (a tip o'the motorcycle helmet to Fa'Tyma) and promised to get there this weekend. Promise kept. How I wish I'd found this place long ago.\n\nNo need to go into many details as Fa'Tyma's review wonderfully checked off all the boxes. The only thing I wanted to add is that when she says \"shaved\" it's shaved in a way I didn't know possible with corned beef. Actually, I'm not sure I would have believed it could be so great so thin. Tal's is very thick compared to this, very. It didn't seem to have that same spicy thing going on that you get from Corky & Lenny's, Mr Brisket or Tal's, but my digestive system didn't miss that in the slightest and neither did I. Wondered if I was going to regret not taking my PCBP (pre-corned beef pepcid) but it was no problem. \n\nTruly amazing corned beef from a modest little place in a neighorhood not known for food, i.e. an object lesson for keeping an open mind and reading and trusting Yelpers.","useful":4,"funny":2,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

I do not say this lightly. She did my wedding make up, and took the time to really learn my skin type and shape as she expertly applied make up like a true artist. She noticed my skin was a little dry (something I didn't even know about myself) and took the time to apply just the right moisturizers before moving forward. \n\nSecond, she truly cares about her clients and makes them feel like it. Why hire someone who knows how to do make up, but won't take the time to make sure everything is how it's suppose to be and that you are TRULY happy? She will go above and beyond. How rare and beautiful is that?! It feels like I've met so many beauticians who just want to make money and have no passion for what they do. This is NOT Heather. You can practically see the light in her eyes as she goes from one step to the next! She seems to be so inspired and it's inspiring to be her client.\n\nLastly, Heather is overall just a fun and welcoming person to be around. I had SO much on my mind for my wedding, and she not only was a great conversation but she made me laugh! I can't tell you how much stress she melted away by her hilarious, genuine, down to earth personality. So basically, she is the whole package. She's talented, genuine, and fun :) \n\nPlease hire this life changing make up artist. You will not regret it!!!","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

We have been several times to another trampoline park in Scottsdale but we wanted to try Sky Park because it is in the neighborhood. \n\nI can only speak to the \"under 7 area\" and the foam pit, because that is where we spent all of our time. We went during the week, so it was not crowded, which was nice. There were only three other children in the area, but one (according to staff) was the owner's son and he was allowed to jump with his shoes ON and climbed up the trampolines, which (also, according to staff) was not permitted. I was extremely frustrated by this, as it encouraged other children to do the same, then when they were asked to stop were confused.  The staff was young and, apparently, afraid to tell this boy that he needed to follow the rules that were implemented for the safety of all customers. I asked the staff member why she didn't ask him to take his shoes off and why she allowed him to climb when it was against the rules.  Her response was a timid \"he is the owner's son.\"  \n\nThe trampoline area was fun and I liked that they had big sofas for parents to sit and watch the children, but I was disappointed it didn't have at least one bounce house with a slide for the younger kids.  The other park in Scottsdale has an area with two bounce houses (both with slides) and a trampoline area just for younger kids, which is really perfect.  I hope that Sky Park will incorporate this. If not, I am not sure we will be back. \n\nThe foam Pit was nice and well organized by staff member who insisted all the children jump one at a time and wait for the other kids to get out before they jump. He said weekends were \"crazy\" and he felt much safer implementing this policy. I was thankful for the attention to this and his work to keep it both fun and safe for smaller children. \n\nAnother complaint - a sign (and policy?) that reads \"no outside drinks including bottled water.\"  This is outrageous to me. If I am paying to bring my children, I am not going to pay $1 or more for each bottle of water. I understand it is an easy way for them to make money but it will discourage me from ever returning unless they change this policy to allow for water.  I understand not allowing soda, coffee, etc. because of the risk of spilling, but prohibiting water is ridiculous and a poor business decision.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

There was so much wrong that I'll just try to sum it up.  \n\nFirstly, I came here with my neighbor and husband and all our collective kids.  We arrived as they opened and we parked in the parking area right in front of the SkyPark.   And despite that when we left we discovered that we got a warning in the form of a parking map on our car window implying that we weren't supposed to park there if we were attending the church next door; what the heck?? \n\n We went in and I had to sign a waiver that basically said that if my kids kill themselves here on a broken spring, torn fabric, etc. even if it's clearly the fault or failure of SkyPark, that I won't hold them liable for anything, ever, period.  In fact, I'm fairly sure that if one of their employees had snapped and whipped out a machine gun and killed everyone I would have also signed away my rights to legal recourse for that event too.   It definitely not a litigious type, but when the establishment is going out of their way to say no matter how badly screwed up our equipment is, if something happens with our haphazard, poorly maintained equipment it's not on them I get very suspicious and it makes me hyper vigilant about everything.  Indeed I saw reason to be hyper vigilant too.  There was evidence that this place is poorly maintained and struggling, badly.  I saw torn spring guards, ripped trampolines, AC units dripping condensation into 55 gallon trash cans, caution tape draped across whole sections that were off limits, and evidence of general deferred maintenance everywhere.  \n\nI directed my kids to the least threating looking area: a foam pit in the back corner, and made a mental note not to come back here.  Then the kids announced they were hungry so I ventured to the almost bare concession stand in the back and asked about the pizza for $14 they advertised on the marquee above the concession stand.  The bored employee texting on his cell phone looked up long enough to tell me that I needed to just call Mama Mia Pizza in the shopping center and order one since that's where they order their pizzas from anyway.  Confused, I confirmed with him that the process to order a pizza for my family though the SkyPark concession stand was just to call Mamma Mia Pizza and order it myself?  Yep.  That's correct.   Okay, so I'll call Mamma Mia Pizza....  (Review continued at Mamma Mia Pizza)","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

To sum it up... I started going 3x a week to get in shape for my wedding. I went in weighing about 148 (I'm 5'9'')... and, I lost 18 pounds in about two months. (Keep in mind, I did absolutely NO working out on my own... So the results are ALL thanks to Kevin). I also built arm and stomach muscle I'd never seen on myself before. On top of that, I changed my eating habits based on Kevin's recommendation... and I will be a Paleo 'dieter' for life. Turns out, grains were the root of my stomach problems...\n\nI am a person who absolutely hates working out. I won't go to the gym on my own. But Kevin keeps your sessions to about 30 minutes... and he varies the exercises to keep things interesting. Kettle bells are awesome. I feel like those give you the biggest results for the least amount of work. He also incorporates barbells, sledge hammers\/tires (my fave!), etc. Kevin also offers bootcamp classes on top of your one-on-one sessions. I have not tried one of these, but it's certainly a nice bonus for anybody who wants to squeeze in an extra workout.\n\nI've worked with a Lifetime fitness trainer in the past, and let me tell you... they don't even compare to Kevin. Plus, they're at least twice as expensive. I highly recommend giving Body Focus Fitness a try. I'm a changed person because of this place!!!","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":3,"type":"review"}

Was promised an estimated time of around 45 minutes to complete my wheel balancing and tire rotation on my car. I waited for almost two hours in the end.\n\nThe technician called me into the service area to show me that my treads were running low and that he recommended we replace all four tires. He was quite correct in his assessment of the tread wear on my tires but after considering my available time schedule, and his quoted price, I opted to  just do the balancing and rotation.\nThe tire replacement quote was in my opinion slightly on the pricey side. Another customer and I rolled our eyes at each other as we overheard another customer being quoted for unexpected repairs to her water pump. It sounded definitely a bit on the high end side. This customer with whom I shared a brief conversation in the waiting area also felt that the quote he got was somewhat high side and even commented to me, out of earshot of the store assistants of course, that he would not be returning here because of the pricey charges. I have to say that I agree with him.\n\nAll this being said, the balancing and rotation was done well on my car; they even took my car for a drive around the block to ensure that the steering shudder I had before was gone. In my experience at least, technicians doing balancing on my wheels usually simply trust that the tires are balanced when the computer says they are. Taking the car for a test drive to confirm it was done properly was going the extra 100yds I'd say.\n\nOverall my opinion is that I think they do good work, at least from the little experience I had with them. They are a little bit pricey though. Would I return? Probably not, I would look for other more cost effective stores. Would I recommend them to someone? In a pinch, perhaps yes, but only in a pinch - if you have the luxury of choice, I'd phone around and get quotes over the phone to see if there are not other alternatives.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

You'll know when you see pictures of pizza.\n\nR.P. is right. The customer service here is above and beyond. The Weekly article had the wrong hours listed (K-Jun closes with the rest of the food court, 9 p.m. on Saturdays). We came in at 9 thinking we had plenty of time. The young gentleman behind the counter, being well-informed, knew we were there because of the mix up. We said we would gladly return during business hours. I mean there's a million great places to eat around there. He then blew my mind. He said he would stay late to make us a pizza. What an insane offer! I felt terrible taking it, but he insisted. So my food companion tipped him well to make his time worth it. He let us order the $20 special. It had a pizza, chicken and two drinks. It's advertised to feed 4+ and it definitely did. He was so generous that I was scared he would get in trouble. I bet he would be the most best friend you could ever have. Someone like this man is such a gem of a person. I would want him to be my partner on Survivor. He even checked on us through our meal.\n\nThe food though is really cool. Korean pizza, HELLO! The bulgogi potato pizza had bits of bulgogi beef, corn, potatoes and other things I'm sure. The pizza sauce was an orangey color and tasted like pasta sauce. The crust seemed to have plenty of cheese  crusties- gooood. It was pretty alright. I wish it came frozen for me to take home. Don't judge me. We had our chicken half plain and half in sauce. I never had chicken like this. The crust is really thick and crunchy. We couldn't put our finger on it and at last we realized it had cinnamon. How cool! We devoured the pickled radishes that came with it. The kind man said they are perfect together. Oh, and he was so right. I love hiiiiim! The other half had a sticky spicy sweet sauce on it. It was good, but I personally prefer the plain. Too messy. The actual chicken pieces come small, but were not dry. I did come across the occasional bone which I find nostalgic.\n\nSo if the Weekly made you curious like me, you should go.

They were fresh, sweet, and crunchy. I never had those things before. \n\nThe Korean Pizza was probably the best thing on the menu. It had sweet potatoes and Korean BBQ beef on it. The beef they got on the pizza is way better than 90% of the Korean restaurants in town. \n\nPersonally, I like the plain chicken over the one with the sauce. \n\nThe portions were pretty big, and they hand batter and fry your chicken the moment you order it. \n\nThis is a pure fusion style restaurant. They also give Tapatio with your chicken and pizza.   Lon L's review was 100% accurate about how the chicken wasn't your traditional Korean fried chicken.   Most Korean fried chickens are very similar to a American southern fried chicken, but with a hint of sesame oil and soy sauce. Traditional Korean fried chicken is prepared by battering the whole chicken without cutting the pieces apart, unlike in America where they batter the individual pieces. Then the whole chicken is flash fried in a pit of boiling oil. After only a couple of seconds they hand you the whole f*cking chicken still in one piece!\n\nWhen I was a little kid in California, I used to eat at this Korean fried chicken place that would actually deep fry the chicken in a combination of Vegetable and  Sesame oil. It was really good.  The chicken here at K-Juns tastes more similar to Tang Su Yuk(spelling). It's covered in a very sticky sweet-sour-spicy sauce. The good news for me is that I really like Tang Su Yuk, so ended up finding the chicken to be enjoyable. \n\nOriginally, I did not want to come here but, my Mom kept insisting on eating here when she came to town recently. My mom went weird a little over a decade ago. She started acting very oddly and her speech pattern became pretty disturbed and strange. While I was driving to Greenland market with her, we had two conversations. The first one was about \"starbucks coffee sent me a free drink coupon\". And the 2nd conversation was about how: \"A friend of mine who is Hawaiian said that K-Jun chicken was bad, so I don't want to eat there\". But, my Mom insisted that she wanted to try it. When we finally got there, she went up to the counter, and incoherently told the worker: \"Starbucks Chicken is bad Hawaiian food\". Now, everywhere my mom goes this happens.   And, everywhere we go people lose there patience with how nutty she is. Workers everywhere can't stand her and get really rude to her.  But, that didn't happen here at K Jun Chicken. The worker was very understanding and sensitive. He never got irritated, never laughed at her, or lost his patience. And he helped my Mom order exactly what she was looking for. It was very nice of him, and I appreciate his kindness. The respectful personality that this worker possesses is exactly what I would expect from a true East Asian person. There used to be a time when Asian-Americans had integrity and honor. We used to respect our elders and not make fun of the disabled. Nowadays a lot of Asian guys here in America(especially the ones around my age) talk all girly and act all snotty, passive-aggressive, and rude to each other. It's literally impossible  to get a long with them.  And a lot of Asian girls are like self-hating(especially at college campuses) and always rant about how they wish they were white and how \"the White man is the superior human being\". Like for example: I had a nightmare situation at a Korean owned sushi place in California where the self-hating Asian girl who was working there immediately let me know that she hated me for being Asian, male, and alive. She didn't even ask me about how many people where in my party, instead she just comes up to me and says all that. Then she kept coming back over and showing me pictures of her white boyfriend on her Iphone, and then started making remarks about how \"Asian guys are ugly and all look alike\". And at the end she made a comment about how Asian men \"oppress women\" and how \"it's not in the white man's nature to treat women badly\".  She wouldn't leave us alone! I believe that if my Mom came into that Sushi restaurant with her mental condition, the Asian chick would have kicked her out. The only reason I stayed was because the owner invited us there that day for a free meal.  And the only reason I haven't left a negative Yelp review on that place is because the owner used to be my next door neighbor. But, moral of this story is that you won't get that kind of treatment here at K-Juns. All you get is respect and good service from traditional East Asian workers. None of that f*cked up sh!t. \n\nOverall, I am happy I came into a Korean restaurant this time and didn't get dissed. Customer service itself deserves 5-stars","useful":7,"funny":7,"cool":6,"type":"review"}

This would happen with no rhyme or reason, disappear randomly (when turning the car off or sometimes while driving) and I was having some noise with the brakes.\n\nAfter giving this to Conant, they took a day to drive it around, had the problem recreate itself, and then hooked it up to the magic machine and reset the sensors which were all (seven of them) reading fail.  The diagnostic showed no actual issues, and they drove it more, trying to figure out where the glitch was.  They kept it another day because they couldn't get it to happen, and still had no luck.  When I came to pick up the car, they refused to bill me because they felt that they didn't actually fix anything other than resetting the computer and that the noise with the brakes was just noise and they weren't grinding or needing work.\n\nPlease, someone find me a mechanic that spends time over two days tinkering with a car, fixing the issue (because the errors haven't happened once in the two weeks since) and then says they won't charge you because they don't think they really did anything worth charging for.

They are honest and upfront about the problems with your car, what it will cost to fix it, and whether or not you should fix it.  Pricing is very reasonable.  \n\nFor example, we had a Chevy cavalier that had a cracked head.  He told me it would cost $1200 to fix it and that it probably wasn't worth it based on the mileage\/year of the car, but they would fix it if we wanted.  We decided not to fix it. You could tell he felt kind of bad for us, and said maybe for $700-$800 he could get it running for another year or so.....which we did decline.\n\nHe has also done some work on our Lincoln, thoroughly investigated the problem, and replaced the rear axle for us, but raised the spector that we should be careful as it was unusal for the axle to rust and he was concerned the car had been flood damaged.  This car also needed a few new cylinders, and again he advised us they could repair it, but it might not be worth it cost-wise for us.\n\nSo my point is: a) they do good work; b) they give good advice; and c) they won't fix your car just to make a buck off of you, when the car might not be worth it in the long run.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The lightly battered prawns were a delight and those Russian roulette peppers made for great entertainment  I got a hot one!! Then there were the cheeses; manchego is always a big tick for me and the goat's cheese with an onion and orange marmalade that I got as the alternative to the meaty paella (which did look tasty and immense!), was a great zingy end to the meal.\n\n\n I'm giving it a 4 star review instead of 5 as I'd like to go back and try a few more of the seafood and vegetarian options to get a full appreciation of the food on offer.

Our friends were in town from Laguna Beach, they naturally wanted to do something that would allow them to experience the beautiful Arizona weather. Once we paid the $16 per person fee for the \"Pick Three\" deal, we stood aside assuming since we told the girl we wanted mini golf first she would assist us with getting our putters and balls and we would go about our day. WRONG! The girl behind the counter went to collecting money from the family of 12 (no exaggeration) that was waiting behind us. Can you believe they actually got all their putters and balls before we even got the consideration of a glance from the employee. \n\nOnce we received our supplies we made our way to the course. Now, I have played at this particular course before and will admit it was an OK time. But this particular time there was a bunch of dead plant material laying in the gutters of what I am sure must have been flowing streams that are now just nonoperational. This must have contributed to the awful stench that closely resembled raw sewage. \n\nBeing that it was hot out, we went back to the concession stand and got drinks and refreshments. The only positive thing I have to say about this experience was the fact that their concession prices were pretty fair. After our quick rest and drinks we were off to the bumper boats to use one of the remaining two activities of our \"Pick Three\" deal. \n\nThere was no line so went went right up to the front. There was not an employee available to help so we waited around for a few minutes before someone finally showed up only to tell us that there were only two bumper boats that were operational. Being that there were five of us, of course, was not really an option. \n\nBy this point, I had decided I was going to make my disappointment know to person in charge. I stopped someone walking by and was directed to the park \"Manager\" who looked to be about 17 or 18 years old soaking wet. I shared my frustration with him and was offered to add more tasks to my \"Pick Three\" offering. That seemed pretty ridiculous considering nothing there was working anyway, so I didn't have to think twice when I declined his extremely generous offer. He then instructed me to visit the Fiddlesticks website and make a complaint to their corporate offices in hopes of getting new battery chargers for the bumper boats. Rest assured I will be contacting the corporate offices by email and sending them a link to this rave review! \n\nSo on to the next event, the go karts. We get in, I push the gas pedal just to be sure that it was working (I was a little gun shy at this point). The kart made a promising vroom vroom vroom and we all took off. After the initial lap was completed it was everyman for himself. Before I could blink an eye, my kart started spitting and sputtering so I pulled off into the \"pit\" and got out and waited the remaining five or six laps for my friends to finish. \n\nOverflowing with frustration, we gathered our crew and left for the day. Each of us out $16 for what I would consider payment for a few hours of my life that I will never get back. \n\nStay away from Fiddlesticks and find something more worthwhile to spend your hard earned dollars on!","useful":6,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Because that's what I'd read about online, you see. Melting, cooling, more chocolate, measuring temperatures - rinse and repeat a million times - to get things just so.\n\nAnd yet, I couldn't imagine that the multitudes of chocolatiers out there were fussing over temperatures and crystal formation like I had over Christmas. I clearly needed some hands-on guidance.\n\nThe first place that came to mind was George Brown. But their Introduction To Chocolate course was overkill - not only was it 11 classes, but it had  a pre-requisite as well. Then I came across Stubbe Chocolates and found their classes to be exactly what I needed: a compact demo with a hands-on component about tempering chocolate. Perfect.\n\nSince most people don't have a giant cooled marble slab at their disposal, the class at Stubbe would teach the widely adopted seed method. We would learn how to properly melt and prepare the chocolate, as well as make our own mendiants and fashion a box made of chocolate to contain them, over the course of two hours.\n\nWith Daniel's calm voice, he guided us through the process while we had some good laughs at are feeble attempts.\n\nIt was a fun evening spent where I was able to learn (and relax) when tempering chocolate - just what I needed. I also managed to snap some great photos (see blog) since the room we were working in was gleamingly bright and white. Thanks to Daniel at Stubbe Chocolates for an informative and entertaining evening.","useful":4,"funny":3,"cool":3,"type":"review"}

Das EBONY war aber so ein Reinfall, dass es unfair wÃ¤re, dies Euch nicht mitzuteilen:\n\n\n Als viel gepriesenes Afrikarestaurant, bei dem eine Tischreservierung empfohlen wird, wunderten wir uns, dass donnerstags nur drei Tische besetzt waren. Erfreut Ã¼ber das GlÃ¼ck, bestellten wir das \"Fischfilet\" mit scharfer TomatensoÃe, GemÃ¼se, Hirse, und eine Platte mit gekochtem und gebratenem Fleisch mit Okras, GemÃ¼se, Hirse, SoÃen.\nNa ja, die KÃ¶chin (Frau des Bestizers) muss Langeweile gehabt haben, denn keine 5 Minuten spÃ¤ter, stand das trostlos aussehende Essen auf dem Tisch:\nBei dem Fisch\"filet\" handelte es sich nicht um ein filetiertes! , sondern um eine breite Scheibe, die schlicht von einem ganzen Fisches abgeschnitten wurde (wie bei einem Laib Brot) also mitsamt RÃ¼ckengrÃ¤te, Haut, Seitenflossen etc., welches total zermatscht (so dass ich es auch nicht mehr zu filetieren vermochte) in einer dicklichen, faden Tomaten?soÃe lag. Und weil nicht nur im Fisch, sondern auch in der SoÃe selbst jede Menge GrÃ¤ten, eine halbe Schwanzflosse und anderes Undefinierbares waren, hatte ich den Eindruck, dass man mir da eine Kelle Restezeug, das als Basis fÃ¼r einen Fischfond gedacht war, auf den Teller gekippt hatte. Die \"GemÃ¼semischung\" dazu bestand genau aus einer halben Karottenscheibe!! , die wohl auch diesem Font-Eintopf entsprungen sein musste und Hirse. Dann wurde mir ungefragt noch einen kleinen ebenso matschigen grau-grÃ¼nen Salat nachgereicht, der wohl als GemÃ¼seersatz herhalten musste. \nZur Fleischplatte: das gekochte Fleisch fehlte gÃ¤nzlich, dafÃ¼r zwei zu kleine gebratene StÃ¼ckchen Rind: eines davon war wirklich zart, das andere dafÃ¼r um so zÃ¤her (wurden diese nicht in der gleichen Pfanne gebraten?), das GemÃ¼se bzw. die Okras fehlten gÃ¤nzlich, an dessen Stelle lag ungefragt ein LÃ¤ngsstÃ¼ck von einer rohen Ananas (zu gebratenem Rind!!!) auf dem Teller dazu ein klitzekleiner Klecks sehr leckere PfefferminzsoÃe und Hirse. \nIch mach's kurz: wir hatten anderes auf dem Teller als bestellt! Das Fischgericht sah aus wie der Inhalt eines SchweinekÃ¼bels, geschmacklich war alles, bis auf den Pfefferminzklecks fad (von afrikanische\/r\/n Exotik\/GewÃ¼rzen keine Spur), weitere Aussagen zum Preis-LeistungsverhÃ¤ltnis im EBONY erÃ¼brigen sich hiermit.\nAuf meine vorsichtige Reklamation hin, dass das aber kein Fischfilet sei, lieÃ der Besitzer lediglich Ã¼ber die Bedienung (seine Tochter) ausrichten: Auch Fischfilets haben GrÃ¤ten! Selbst in Touristenhochburgen habe ich diesen Grad von Ignoranz und Abzocke bisher noch nicht erlebt! \nWir haben oft Afrika (SÃ¼dafrika, Zentralafrika) bereist, dort auch mit so wunderbaren Menschen (im Dschungel) einfachste, aber schmackhafte Gerichte aus einem Kessel gegessen und ich kann nur sagen: das EBONY hat aber auch gar nichts mit Afrika zu tun.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Are we still supposed to be concerned with it?  Is it still a relevant topic in  the culinary arts? \n\nI'll jump the border and cross the Rio Grande if I want tacos from Mexico. If I just want to eat some quality tacos without the need for a passport, I'll cross the Monongahela and head East. \n\nThis past weekend, after experiencing the Shadyside Arts Festival, Kay and I replenished ourselves at Chica Loca Taco after it captured the corner of my eye several times as we strolled up and down Walnut Street.\n\nNearly stark mad with hunger, I was greeted by an eclectic staff of cheery youngsters and ordered a trio of torridly tantalizing tacos: The Carnitas, The Pescado, and The Cardon.\n\nThe Pescado was the weightiest of the triad and contained a chunk of fish too large to be tilapia (???) that was dressed with slaw, \"quesa fresca,\" and a sort of \"crema\" or mayonnaise. \n\nI found nothing \"dry\" about any of the tacos, from the doubled-up tortilla to all  the vegetables and meats that filled them. The Pescado, with its tender, wet, steamy seafood filet was the feature of our dinner. Saltwater flavors merged with the buttery essence of the dressing and the crunch of the coleslaw, taking me to a tropical paradise of the mind and palate. \n\nThe Cardon contained diced onions and cilantro along with its cubed, grilled steak, and The Carnitas did much the same except with shredded, slow-cooked pork. While the Pescado's inspired, seaborne excellence outshined both, neither of these \"land\" tacos disappointed, both containing supple meats that were complimented by potent aromatics and sharp, crumbled cheese.\n\nMy stomach demanding even more, I also had a bowl of their fatty, chunky, glistening guacamole along with plenty of their auric, brittle and highly flavorful tortilla chips and a slightly bitter, reduced, smoky, and altogether mysterious salsa. The guacamole was neither baby food nor merely chopped avocado. Rather it met the ideal balance between smooth and lumpy, smearing onto each elegant, delicate, and triumphantly unctuous chip like the green lard that it is. And don't read my review the wrong way; I liked the salsa, its taste being one that could be considered acquired even if I picked it up quickly.\n\nKay was gracious enough to allow me a bite of her corn-on-the-cob, a.k.a. Mexican Style Street Corn, and Madre De Dios, I shall NEVER take this summery side-dish for granted again during the remainder of my Earthbound days. You see, I'm used to simply salting and buttering my corn cobs. CLT goes anotha mutha furtha and slathers some sort of \"special sauce\" onto it that recalls Russian Dressing or remoulade, thus shooting it straight up towards Tamoanchan for the old gods to enjoy. And were those fat kernels ever sweet, sweet perfection on a stick, made all the sweeter by the clandestine condiment. \n\nFeeling for fro-yo, we skipped the CLT's gelato and headed to Happy Berry instead. \n\nIf Chica Loca Taco tried to \"fool\" me into thinking they serve optimal tacos, then call me a fool for I was willingly deceived.\n\nP.S. My 3 tacos, Kay's single taco, our chips, our salsa, our guacamole, and 1 bottled beverage for each of us came to $31 and some change. Great grub on the cheap...in opulent Shadyside? It wasn't fast food. It was Chica Loca Taco! Hijole!","useful":14,"funny":11,"cool":11,"type":"review"}

I'm so happy to have found this place considering that restaurants in the walnut area tend to be a little pricey however I do wish the taco prices were a little lower considering their size.

The gal at the counter was so amiable and talkative that I almost thought I'd say what would have improved our meal in person, but I felt like I was being too picky at the time.  But on the walk home with my friend, we both were talking about how though we were too full to stop for yogurt, we really weren't satisfied. \n\nWe tried a four different kinds of tacos and they were ok, the best were the fish and the veggie because they required the least additional seasoning.  The carnitas and the chicken were kind of tough and really lacking seasoning.  The salsas were ok too, I preferred the verde over the house, which we thought was supposed to be medium spice but either my taste buds have built up an incredible tolerance or that was the most bland medium ever.   \n\nOverall this place has a lot of potential, but the food would benefit from more flavor from both more fresh herbs and spices and slightly more salt, especially on the corn tortillas. I think it's a pretty easy fix and also maybe the serving time could be a lot faster, it took about 15 minutes and that's not long for sitting down, but this is a street food concept so it should be quick and there were only two other diners (eating there, but maybe they were slammed with take out?)  I'll for sure be back because it's the only thing like this in the neighborhood and I think I could just ask for extra spice and herbs.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Grocery shopping is definitely a pain, so I tried out Von's grocery delivery service for the first time. I found it easy to arrange, as their website makes choosing products very simple.  I tend to buy mostly produce, and found that  everything I wanted was available.  The only problem I encountered was in updating the number of items in the cart. I would think I had successfully downgraded only to find that I still had multiple numbers of something, or that I still had less than the number I wanted.  I think that's more a function of my being new to the site than a problem on their end.\n\nBefore sending your order in there is a little \"matrix\" where you check the kind of substitution you will accept if your item is unavailable. For example, I wanted a 16 ounce package of pico de gallo, but would accept the same amount made by a different company.\n\nSetting up a time for next-day delivery was simple- you get a window of a couple of hours. My delivery was made right on time by a very friendly guy who had the perishables separated from the non-perishables, and a nice printout of my purchases with the final price on it. He went over my list in order to point out that that a substitution had been made for the pico de gallo- I got two 7-oz containers of a different brand, as they were out of the type I'd chosen. Since I was prepared for possible substitutions, I was fine with that.  \n\nSo, my delivery was timely, the produce was in good shape, the final price was within a couple of dollars or so of the estimated price (they have to allow for produce weight and substitutions so you don't know the exact full price until it's delivered), and the delivery guy was friendly and professional.  \n\nThis delivery was free, but future ones will cost about $15 I believe.  That's really  not bad, considering I'd have to make multiple trips or take a cab at least one way if I shopped on my car-less own.","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

Quite filling and satisfying. \n\nI want to try their soups next :)\n\nLine up seems long, but it moves quickly.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I made a few visits there because I bought a gift card from one of the daily deal sites at half price.  I think it was a $40 card for $20.  In my opinion, that's the only way that this place is reasonable.  Yes, they have a wide selection of wraps and salads.  But they are incredibly skimpy on the higher quality ingredients, especially the protein.  For example, twice I tried the cobb wrap (with chicken and bacon), for about $9.  Both times it had  a discernible amount of chicken, yes, but the bacon was of the invisible variety (not my favorite kind).  I had a similar experience when I \"built my own\" wrap, and actually I'm still pretty sure that one of the ingredients (for which I paid $1.50) was left out of the wrap completely.\n\nAll that said, Freshii is healthy and for many of the office workers that flock there, they need this as an option.  I just think Freshii could do a better job by ensuring that their products contain less filler.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

So I went into this store after I saw a pair of shoes in the window that I liked but unfortunately they didn't have my size and it wasn't practical to go back or ship me a pair.   I then saw a sign saying 'Suit, Shirt and Tie for $200' so I talked to the manager, Hicham and he showed the suits that were included.   I asked how good could they really be considering the shirts and ties were selling at approx $40 each and he showed me a previous label of around $699 and that he was getting rid of 'lower quantity stock' that wasn't moving. \nSo I tried on the suit and loved it, but it was a little small in the pants, and the 'next size up's' jacket made me look silly.. This being the case he got the pants altered for me (opened the waist and legs) and they would be ready later that evening.  I chose the shirt that was offered in the deal and bargained another into the deal instead of the tie.   In addition I bought another fancy shirt getting a bit if a further discount for all the purchases. \nSo bottom line, Hicham was very consultative, knowledgeable and never pushy - he made this the best clothes buying experience I can remember in a long while.  I wore the suit and fancy shirt that evening and felt like a million dollars !\n\nAfter I got back home and wore the suit another couple of times I found a problem with the stitching and it would need re-tailored.   I emailed Hicham pictures of the problem and he responded not only fixing the issue to hand but went the next step in making me happy and sending me a gift that made me smile.\n\nI have never had service like this from a clothes retailer.  The stock in the shop is beautiful and I will shop from him again next time I am in town. Way to go !!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Surrounded by a residential area and the ominous glow of Lutheran Hospital, it is not the most ideal location for a restaurant.\n\nStepping into the restaurant, you will notice a lot of blue. As in the bold colored blue walls. The dÃ©cor is a blend of old-school lounge melded with modern touches and lighting. Service was very gracious and friendly. The space itself is intimate with one small room with jazz performers playing at one end of the room and a bar along the wall of the room.\n\nWent on a Friday night and the restaurant was about half full. Similar type of crowd as at Nighttown. The jazz group, Paul Stranahan Trio was setting up to play at 8:00. Awesome concept, having live jazz Wednesday through Saturday. Sweetness!\n\nDrinks are very affordable. Majority of bottles of wines are in the mid-twenty buck range. Various traditional martinis and mixed drinks offered, as well as own specialty cocktails as well. We got a 25 dollar bottle of Vouvray that was quite nice.\n\nNice assortment of small plates\/appetizers are offered, check out the menu on their website. We were debating getting several small plates a la tapas, as many looked tasty like: peach wedges wrapped with ham and basil, shrimp grapefruit cocktail, gumbo and potato-apple pancakes; but instead opted to go for entrees. The waiter brought us a basket of breads that included a typical baguette style white bread and a tasty nut and raisin bread accompanied by an olive tapenade and sweet butter spread. Both with excellent flavors.\n\nOnto the entrees...the Bell & Evans airline breast chicken was roasted to perfection. Crisp delectable skin covered tender and juicy pieces of breast meat on the inside. One of the most flavorful well-cooked pieces of chicken I have ever had. Mmm-mmm. On the side was roasted, crispy slices of apple wrapped with bacon (must mention again, everything wrapped with bacon makes it better), pureed sweet potatoes (just the right amount of sweetness) and a small pile of sautÃ©ed spinach. The juices of the chicken, mixed with the flavor of the bacon and sweetness of the apples created a perfect balance. The salmon fillet was cooked to just the right temperature, not dry and not \"rare\". Excellent flavor with carmelized onions on top and with a side of sweet potatoes and grilled asparagus in lemon butter. Mmm-mmm again.\n\nThe portions were just right for the entrees. They had some excellent looking desserts that the waiter displayed for us on a plate. However, we were happily filled and sipping our wine while enjoying the music. We were sitting one table away from the band, and the volume was just right; able to hold a conversation without yelling.\n\nOverall, had a wonderful meal. Only minimal complaint would be the prices. They were slightly a little bit on the high side. Not sure if business is taking a hit, but the prices on the menu for the entrees on the website are not accurate. Currently, the prices for the entrees are two dollars more than advertised. The chicken entrÃ©e was $20. The small plates are still the same advertised price online.\n\nEnjoy the tunes and food, keep this place going and perhaps get the prices done. Cheers!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Aqua blue hits your eyes when you first step in. A cozy bar stretches from the entrance to the back of the kitchen on the right side.

Now....this may be a good or a bad thing - it depends on what kind of night you are looking for ;) It had been a Wednesday evening in November and it was pouring rain out. However.... I don't think there's anything better than sitting in an empty room with candles all lit up with a personal live Jazz performance as background music. Well maybe not background music since the singing was a bit loud and overpowered our conversation at times. Were they just vying for our attention? :) After their performances, the musicians\/owners (amnesia on names) were friendly enough to chat with us, making it a little less awkward since we were the only 2 in the room - and also letting us know they weren't just going to eavesdrop on our conversation the entire time. Later on in the night, the power went out! Everything went dark - which I think made the restaurant 100 times more romantic because of all the candles....and also wasn't blinded by the hideous blue paint on the walls!\n\nDespite my positive review, I would only give this place 3 stars from a food\/drink standpoint but giving it a 4 because of the atmosphere and live Jazz performance :)\n\nAppetizer: Apple pancake w\/ Salmon\nEntree: Airline Chicken w\/ Spinach and Sweet Potato Mash\nDrink: Basil Vodka\nAll yummy.\n\nOverall, a great place to take your date for great Live Jazz (the smoky kind) and special alone-time....","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

They then (albeit gently) again suggested I upgrade to \"bespoke\" so I could get a similar fabric.\n\nI was frustrated at how long it took them to identify the issue, so I ultimately asked for a refund and they didn't fuss too much and reasonably promptly refunded my credit card today.\n\nTo give them the benefit of the doubt, they very well may have been a \"one off\" kind of mess up, but I lost patience and am now in the market for a competitor.","useful":5,"funny":1,"cool":3,"type":"review"}

This used to be a great store and then they got rid of all their good workers except for one. The customers are the best thing about this place. Aside from the stereotypical social awkwardness, they're usually great people. The customers in the side room are always nice and willing to play games or teach them to new people.\n\nAside from that, and I hate to say it, this place is terrible. They're more expensive than what you can get on Amazon or other places. I used to be willing to pay the extra back when the workers were good, but not any more.\n\nThe workers, as I've been saying, are horrible. The issue changes from worker to worker. Some don't pay attention to customers and others are just plain creepy. One of the workers are so creepy I refuse to go in the store when they work. The owner used to be really great, but she's kind of teetered off. I don't really know how to describe the change. It's like she's checked out. The one great thing about her is that she really is helpful to any customers who don't know much about games.

If that does not get you motivated wait till you see the prices....\n\nThe lunch specials are priced at $4.55 for a combo plate and $5.55 for the shrimp combo plates. With 20 different combos I am sure you will find something you like.  A soda will set you back $1.25 or go for 1 can of soda for .85 cents.  Hot tea and water was my choice.\n\nThe Restaurant just opened last month so it still needs some work....Some empty fish tanks, needs some ceiling pieces replaced, but it really is a great place for authentic fast food Chinese.  I wish this place was closer to my home since they offer delivery. Yes you have to spend over $12.00 for delivery, but that would be easy for dinner or an office ordering lunch.\n\nIf you are craving dinner and are on a budget you can still eat here.  Not one plate on the menu is over $8.00!  I think I ordered enough to feed a family 2 nights in a row, plus lunch for work and for about $30. \n\nOK so if price does not entice you the fresh food and delicious entrees will.  We ordered several different dishes and I cannot complain about any of them.  We loved the lo mein, beef egg foo young, Mongolian beef, fried rice, and cashew shrimp.  They gave us plenty of crab puffs for free as well plus a large container of white rice.  I generally am not a fan of the crab puffs, but the cream cheese was fresh and the fried puff seemed to be light and crispy.  \n\nIf you are on a diet or really watching your calorie intake they even have lo cal entrees on the menu, not the norm at a Chinese Restaurant.  Chicken, shrimp, or a vegetable plate for you serious calorie number watchers.\n\nMy family and I all loved the food here.  I hope you will give them an opportunity to earn your business.  The price for food is excellent and what shocked me more is the food is excellent.  Based on Max's review I gave it a shot and now my whole family is thanking me for a new found place to eat.

I probably wouldnt buy anything from the deli or bakery in their current states.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The place is well-maintained with ample bunkers and some water hazards.\n The driving range really shines though.  The mats in the covered range are more like newer professional field turf than the common patio enclosure green astroturf you find at most places.

Finally get seated and there we sit for another 5-10min before they bring us water. The place was empty. We told her we knew what we wanted before she took off again..and we have a todler so we are always close to a temper tantrum. The food arrived and I had ribs w\/mashed & corn,  hubby had  steak & baked potato. My ribs were not very good at all. There was not enough sauce so I waited for our server to come back and check on us and she never did. Hubby had to go and find someone. When the sauce came out it was boiling hot. Very weird. Hubby said steak was ok..not as good as it usually is.  We also had to wait forever for the check. I hope they were having an off night..cuz it will be awhile until I try here again. Which sucks cuz I usually love this location.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Their food all seems to be based on American classics with a chef's flair- which is perfect for me since i'm not a fan of spicey or overly seasoned foods.   I had the Twisted Turkey Sandwich (w\/out the onions since i don't care for them) and it was to die for!  The fresh carved turkey was perfectly tender and juicy and the cranberry aioli gave just the right amount of added flavor while still letting the taste of the turkey take center stage.  And don't even get me started on the Rosemary Tots... I think i may need to seek professional help for my addiction to those yummy little fried potatoes all coated in delicious, fresh, flavorful rosemary.  YUMMMMM!!!!   \n\nAnd the service was top notch. The workers were all super nice, polite (even during my radical request to change their perfect-just-the-way-it-is food), and they legimately seemed like they were enjoying themselves which i think makes for a great atmosphere :)\n\nThe only thing I'd like to see different is the option to have your tots unsalted.  I'm not a fan of salt (or the bloating that comes with it) so even though the tots were only lightly salted and it didn't affect the flavor negatively, i'd still like to see the option to get them without.   \n\nOverall,  I've tried a few other trucks now (that i will be reviewing one by one in my spare time) and i have to say that The Nosh Box is definitely my favorite Cleveland area food truck!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Actually I don't get food from food trucks too often... not a fan of the lines, somewhat higher prices and hanging around outside if it's hot.  But I figured I would give this one a try; and I must say it has kinda changed my mind about all the reasons I didn't go to food trucks previously.\n\nI purchased the vegetable wrap and some fries.  Usually a veggie wrap isn't enough to fill me up, hence the fries.  So when my order was complete and I was handed both, I was quite surprised at just how MUCH food I was given.  Could I eat all this?  I sat down and worked on that issue.\n\nCalling this thing a wrap perhaps do it justice.  It's actuall a huge, thick and grilled flatbread topped with yummy hummus, massive grilled vegetable chunks, and perhaps another sauce I can't quite remember.  I just remember the delicious journey involved as I ate this (relatively) healthy beast of a wrap.  \n\nThe only problem I encountered with my meal was not knowing what I liked better; the fries or the wrap.  I finished both fries and wrap, and loved whatever seasoning\/oil the fries were cooked in.  All in all, the best veggie wrap I've ever had in addition to some darn good fries.\n\nOverall kinda pricey... overall for a lunch, $7 for the wrap and $3 for the fries.  So not something I'd get every day... plus, I doubt it's all around great health food.  But hope this food truck comes to my job more often, and I'll perhaps be inspired to not pack lunch as much.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Could this be because I was referred to him as someone who would do a bilateral procedure on my spine and not tow unilateral procedures but the referring doctor is upset because I complained here was NO MEDICAL NECESSITY for 2 procedure and it was to collect more money from the insurance company?\n\nDr. Harris started out pretty icy and asked \"So why are you here?\"  You could tell he already had an opinion of some sort.  I explained that I first went to Nevada Orthopaedic and spine where I had appointment after appointment, found multiple over-billings and never even got to a diagnosis so then I was referred by my doc to Innovative Pain who told me they were in network with Blue Cross but were not AND Dr. Wu told me there was no medical reason to have 2 procedures and I had to talk to the office manager where I found out it was so they got paid more.... and they referred me to you and I called in advance to verify that you can bill correctly and will do both sides of my messed up spine in one procedure.

His explanation was they did a lot of procedures and were busy.   \n\nApparently they don't study math in med school.   30+30= 60.... and you eliminate one prep and sedation period so it would actually take LESS time!\n\nDr. Harris's cold and compassionless 5 minutes told me all I need to know.  He shouldn't be practicing medicine.  Everyone in the lobby was talking about their meds and getting Lortab refills etc...

Honestly, this is the only thing in the building, all other businesses that once took up shop here, left.  I wouldn't come here for my post office needs, especially since the one in Swissvale is much nicer, and doesn't look like a haunted house on the inside.\n\nOne thing that is better here is space.

Here is the saga... I have been through 3 different pool companies before we started doing it ourselves... and then failed at it. I fired the other pool companies because they didn't show up let my pool turn green, demanded that I get a pool robot, took my filter apart then said they couldn't put it back together and left it like that, constantly tried to sell me more and more products and services to fix my algae problem, dumped a whole bag of soda ash in my pool, used my own pool chemicals instead of providing their own, left garbage all around my yard, and various other problems. I decided to find a pool company that knew how to treat customers and actually cares about their work.\n\nAdmittedly, I have an older \"problem\" pool that is in need of new plaster, and it has older equipment. It turns out that my pool developed cracks and divits when the pool was empty when it was a foreclosure. The newly formed cracks made it end up getting a black algae problem, and no matter how much chlorine, scrubbing, and metal brushing, and chemicals - the thing turned green within a week during the summer months, even with regular pool service from multiple different companies over the years. I got new water twice, did chlorine baths, did every treatment that the pool store suggested, scrubbed it with a wire brush manually while in the pool with goggles on, and still never could swim in my pool comfortably all the time in the summer. It would always turn green within less than a week. And even with multiple chlorine floaters in it, new filters, a chlorine bath, proper chemical levels, the thing still turned green.\n\nWhen I hired Summer Pools, I explained them all of my hassles before, and they decided to take my problem pool on, with the explanation that they would try to get me through the summer, but would not make any promises. They used a special algae solution to combat my issues, came weekly on schedule, texted me to put away the dogs every time, and actually got me through the summer without issues of any kind. ALL SUMMER LONG.. This was a miracle. \n\nTheir prices are on par with what we paid every other company, the difference is that Steven is actually a human that cares about his work, has integrity, has good customer service, and he does what he says he is going to do.  \n\nSteven is awesome all the way around, I can't say anything negative about him at all. He cleans \"Robby the robot\" when he gets palm trees stuck in him, and best thing is we were actually problem free all summer and were able to use the pool at will, anytime we wanted.. ALL SUMMER LONG! \n\nIf you have a problem pool, or just have received bad service in the past, I would suggest trying these guys out. Seriously. \n\nFYI - I do plan to fix my pool and get it plastered when I can save up the $7k to get new tile and plaster. Then all of my issues will be gone forever.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

By their very nature banks tend to suck... But, not so with Wells Fargo and especially this mini-branch inside a Safeway Supermarket. I have had my personal accounts there since 2007, but what really made me appreciate this branch was when I started doing business banking there. First, I opened a business checking account for the advertising payments I started receiving from Google for a couple of my blogs. Then, when we grew the business and incorporated as Automotive Media Partners, LLC I went to this branch to meet with them. The business banking manager walked me through various options for setting up our new company accounts, handled everything very professionally and provided a level of service that exceeds what I have come to expect from banks. He set up accounts for AR, AP and Equity. The Wells Fargo banker set up my Merchant Services account so we could take credit card payments... At a discount rate of 2% and 2.25% for Amex (very low cost). Then he went on to approve a line of credit for the company that far exceeded what I expected.  AMP has exceeded our revenue forecasts for 2012 and I am appreciative enough for Wells Fargo and the way this branch treats me an my company to be fiercely loyal. My investors have tried to get me to move accounts to B of A and I have insisted that we keep our growing business accounts with Wells Fargo and this branch.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Kind of like a poppyseed muffin with fruity bits\/jam. \n\n-maple bacon: no hesitation to buy this one at all bc this is a hard flavor to find & one I absolutely love!!

I happened upon here today for lunch and can't believe in all the years I've been hangin in the s. side I never stopped prior.  The space itself is very nice it has exposed brick a nice bar with plenty of seating and multiple booths with dark wood and leather all around.  The only one complaint that I have about my initial impression is that it did  smell a little bit like my basement used to smell after a keg party in college when I first walked in.  I was greeted warmly by one of the servers \"Li Li\" I believe.  She was very friendly and we chatted for a while.  The bartender was \"Bear\".  He was a good typical burgh' bartender.  He served me a guiness quickly and knew the point spreads for all the college and pro games.  I ordered the \"ultimate burger\" which I ordered medium and they let me substitute a cup of french onion soup instead of getting fries.  Incidentally, they were very amenable to all kinds of sub stitutions as I witnessed while others ordered at the bar.  The soup was forgettable.  The broth itself was tasty enough and well seasoned, but the cheese wasn't burnt, it looked like they skipped putting it under the broiler.  It really doesn't matter the burger was the main feature.  Incidentally, I had no idea that this place was known for burgers, so it looks like I lucked out with the order.  The burger arrived quick enough it was a big 8 oz. burger overflowing with brie.  The burger was served on a perfectly toasted warm italian roll.  The burger itself was cooked perfectly and had great flavor.  I'm pretty sure this meat is ground fresh daily and never frozen.  It very much reminded me of a Tessaros burger (and quite frankly maybe it was just as good, but I can't bring myself to say it).  The staff was so friendly I found myself staying for 3 guiness instead of a typical 1 beer lunch portion.  I will go again and stick to the burgers.  The rest of the menu was very reasonably priced, but again I think the burger is the star.  Incidentally, I was speaking with a friend in the restaurant business after lunch and the guy who originally opened tessaros is the current owner of city grill, so that accounts for much of the similiarity.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

I've been a huge fan of Charlie Trotter's in Chicago, and was excited to try out his new place in Las Vegas emphasizing seafood. Maybe it was because it was so late (9:30pm on a Friday night after a show) but the servers were definitely not on their game. Though they advertise that they take reservations until 11:00pm, there was just one other party in the restaurant.\n\nI started out with a nice, albeit expensive glass of Schramsberg, and was greeted by a refreshing amuse consisting of a little pile of Peekytoe crab seasoned with light citrus and vinegar flavors. As an aside, I wonder what the attraction of Peekytoe crab is...it seems that it is always somewhat tough and stringy. I much prefer Maryland Blue Crab. \n\nI started out with a Fruits de Mer with spot prawns, cockles, and oysters. The presentation was lovely but it was oversalted. Furthermore, though chilled, I didn't realize that the spot prawns would be raw...they weren't even cured by the citrus, and as a result, were unpleasantly mushy with a lingering aftertaste. The dish was garnished with two deep-fried shrimp heads, but these were lukewarm and tasted like they had been done well in advance of plating. \n\nMy wife had spiced artichokes with honey and pine nuts. Now these were delicious. The artichokes were deep-fried and seasoned with some Moroccan-inspired heat. Great dish.\n\nI proceeded to have the Lobster tart with chorizo and trumpet mushrooms. This was again marred by oversalting and the generous chunks of lobster were a bit overdone. Conceptually, the problem I have with this dish is that there was an overwhelming amount of chorizo that had been overcooked resulting in a vinaigrette with lots of \"pebbles\". \n\nFinally, I had the hamachi with braised short ribs and trumpet mushrooms. It was okay. The short ribs tasted a little on the tough and stringy side, and again seemed oversalted to me (I wonder if they had been sitting around too long out of their braising liquid through the course of the day). The fish, though nice and rare in the middle, seems to have been seared at too high a temperature so that the exterior was overdone...I've never encoutered that before!\n\nIn the meantime, my wife had the ocean trout with oysters and hijiki. The oysters were perfectly poached and remained meltingly tender albeit too salty, but the trout again tasted overdone and chewy. \n\nWe would have given a pass on the food if the service were better. It was very friendly and as a result, it was very difficult to post a negative review. But it seemed unattentive. We had a dining companion who was vegetarian but did not like beets. We made this clear to the many servers which attended us. So the amuse came with roasted beets. We pointed this out to the server. Then her next dish came with beets. We again had to point this out.\n\nAgain, this dining experience was so disappointing in view of the fact that I love Charlie Trotter's so much. For my wife's two courses and my three courses, a glass of Schramsberg and a glass of chablis, tax and tip, we paid nearly $300 (way overpriced). The place did have the air of a place doomed to impending failure wafting about.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

I was completely unprepared for her passing, she had just turned 30 and was full of life. Whether I was prepared or not, funeral arrangements needed to be made right away.\n\nI went to several funeral homes to find the one that really just had the right feel. The right feel for me was a combination of the people that would be assisting and helping us and atmosphere of the place inside and out.  I didn't want some dumpy looking place that I was further depressed stepping into.\n\nI was impressed with the people that ran the funeral home.  They were professional and compassionate.  Sympathetic without being phoney.  I didn't feel like it was all about the money or that I was dealing with snakes.  Everyone was very nice and helpful.  The woman that held our services was great.\n\nThey offered options and choices for additional costs but were not tacky in their approach of presenting the different options.  They have a full showroom in the back, where you can choose a casket and all of the little things that you don't really think of, like sign in books or even having your loved ones fingerprint put onto a necklace.  I purchased my casket online from a company that delivered overnight and didn't charge any shipping costs (the cost is like $1,000.00 - $2,000.00 less if you do this -for the same casket), but it is nice that they had the caskets available and ready at their location.  I couldn't bring myself to buy the fingerprint necklace (it felt a little morbid but I wish I would have gotten it now) but I did get a sign in book and some other things that I needed and it was nice to know everything was on hand.  They also were able to provide everything for the service and there are lots of little things.  It's like planning a wedding to a certain extent, there is always something else you need to have that you didn't think of.\n\nThe facilities are really nice inside and out.  The building is very well maintained and the landscaping is nicely groomed.  Everything was very clean.  They have two viewing rooms, one is larger and one is a little bit smaller and more intimate.  Both viewing rooms were very well maintained and comfortable.  I choose the smaller, more intimate space and was very happy with it.\n\nI was also happy with the understanding that they had for my requests.  I was able to go in and see my sister's body before anyone else and before the day of the viewing.  They allowed me to come into the funeral home on the day of the viewing several hours before the viewing began and spend four or five hours getting her hair and makeup right - by myself without anyone interrupting me (I'm really happy they let me do this because when my mom finally had to see her at the viewing, she looked more like herself but like she was just sleeping).  They also gave me the option of being present when they dressed her as I was uncomfortable with anyone handling her body - but in the end, I let them dress her as I felt comfortable with their professionalism and I needed to go home and shower and dress for her ceremony.  All in all, they were very nice and understanding.\n\nI recommend nobody you love ever passing away but if it happens and you need to find a funeral home, this is a really nice place with top notch people running it.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

So in the past few months I've been to his office four or five times.\n\nI have had some horrific experiences with other dentists in the past, so I approached this endeavor with more than a little fear, so I did some research. I knew I wanted a holistic dentist who agrees with me (or at least doesn't disagree with me) that having a mouth full of mercury is a bad idea in general, and that fluoride is poison. \n\nSo I used the online \"find a dentist\" directory at the Holistic Dental Association's web site, and did the same at the IAOMT's web site. Dr. Heltzel is fully certified by both organizations.\n\nDoing my homework paid off, and my fears were baseless.  Dr. Heltzel is highly skilled, very thorough, and exceedingly gentle. I am in good hands with him, and with his office staff. Each member of his staff is professional, caring, and everyone goes out of their way to make sure I'm comfortable when I visit.  \n\nMy teeth are looking so much better, and I'm even feeling better too, thanks to Dr. Heltzel!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Recently I started getting my metal fillings replaced (7 total) and my satisfaction level has only doubled with all of this work! \nFirst off, I have a million questions regarding my complete restoration, and I've never felt rushed or pushed aside by staff. Yvonne, Rhonda, Susan, and the Doctor have all spent a LOT of time with me helping me understand my options and all the variables involved.  \nThen, in the chair, I've always been pleased with my cleanings, and I love the natural and holistic approach.  Replacing my fillings with Dr. Heltzel has been the best dentistry I've ever had - and I've had it all, and by many dentists!  I was so nervous for my first appointment, I have such negative emotions tied to the dentist chair from all my past work, I thought this was going to be horrible.  I was pleasantly surprised the entire process, even the novocaine they use is different and way less intense than I've ever had.  (I'm told his injection doesn't contain as many additives, like preservatives, which raise the blood pressure and give me an awful feeling when being injected.)  Dr. Heltzel and Rhonda work very well together and are both so caring and kind. Rhonda really plays a great supporting role and made me feel so comfortable at each appointment, she's also a pleasure to talk to in between all the work.  \nI'm so happy with every aspect of Dr. Heltzel's practice that I don't mind driving a half hour from the NW.  This is my favorite out of all my prior dentists. I hope I stay in Vegas long enough to get all of my dentistry desires taken care of because I doubt I'll find another dentist I trust as much as Dr. Heltzel.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Cookies), then this place will fill you with the familiar smells, taste, as well as satisfying your sweet craving.\n\nThe offerings change but there are always some constants.  Didem takes pride in her creations and it most certainly shows in her enthusiasm as well as patience in explaining the various goodies to you. She will even let you taste various cookies before you can settle your mind. If you are like me and you can't make up your mind between the choices, just get a couple of each - trust me you will not regret.  In here quality does NOT diminish with quantity.  \n\nDuring my last visit, I had the Sesame seed savories ( these go perfectly with a cup of Earl Grey tea) , 3 different flavors of ( colored to match the flavor ) cream cookies, and Almond-Hazlenut Cookies ( come in a pack of two ).  None of these tasted like the dry crunchy cookies otherwise found in chain stores. They are a perfect combination of flakiness on the outside with just the right consistency of softness inside.  One bite and I bet you won't be able to put it down.  I could feel my sweet tooth giving a sigh of utter satisfaction.  Didem will even entertain any special order request you might have.

It took me about 30 minutes to do so and I was able to leave at around noon. \n\nThe amenities inside the building seemed promising. I bought a pretty decent white mocha from the coffee shop and I saw that there was a Capriottis too.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I went from \"how can I finagle my way out of this,\" to \"how can I get ON a jury.\" The difference? My unemployment benefits are long gone. I NEED the money. Even if it's only $40 a day. \n\nThanks to my low number, I was among the first 45 potential jurors herded into line. I was included in the first 23, designated the \"panel.\" That means I was one of the prime candidates. The additional 22 are drafted to assure a sufficient number to round out a jury after the grueling \"voir dire\" phase, the process by which jurors with potential biases are identified and excused.\n\nFrom the getgo, the case was explained as open-and-shut, likely to last only two days. Hey, 80 bucks! Enough to pay a utility bill or at the very least a little beer money. I kept quiet throughout the questioning. Prospective jurors are invited to relate their experiences about past encounters with law enforcement and the justice system. Had I any qualms about my ability to be impartial, I would have spoken up. I was under oath, after all. I decided hell no, I can be impartial. \n\nFor those wishing to escape jury duty, here is your chance. Just make an issue about any voir dire topic and you will likely be excused. It doesn't mean you are not worthy. From a pool of 45, 13 are selected based on their answers during voir dire. Getting excused from one panel doesn't necessarily get you off the hook, however. You must report back to Jury Services for possible reassignment.\n\nAfter the jury was empaneled (I was #12), a young woman protested that she had a job interview the following morning. \"Why didn't you say something?\" the judge asked. \"I didn't think I would be excused,\" she said. She needs a life coach. You are given every chance to state your reasons for not serving. The flimsiest excuse might be honored. If the judge and the attorneys agree, boom, you're gone. After the trial, the kindly judge (The Honorable Douglas W. Herndon) went so far as to apologize to the young lass. He told her he would gladly speak to the recruiter. \n\nUp to five days before your reporting date, you can call the automated system and reschedule.\n\nWhereas my first experience was painless, this time was a horror show. A thousand prospective jurors were called. The jury corral was crammed beyond capacity, with as many as 100 draftees having to stand outside until seating came available. Meanwhile, those inside the corral had to suffer in stifling heat, struggling for a breath of fresh air. Those with body odor issues made matters worse.\n\nJudge Herndon later explained that the throng of 1000 included 250 for one murder trial alone. The scene at the Fremont Street parking garage was another fright. The line to get in wound around two blocks. It took me 20 minutes to get in. Toward the front subhumans tried to barge in. Some fools actually let 'em. I say don't give these lowlifes an inch. What makes people like this feel entitled to cut in front and not wait like all the other chumps? One juror paid $20 at another garage rather than fight the mob.\n\nThe line waiting to get into the courthouse wound out the door and down the block. Another lengthy wait in the chilly wind. \n\nOnce inside, the gathering was subjected to a tiresome movie featuring the reprehensible and revolting husband-and-wife news team known as the Wagners. They managed to mangle the legal term \"peremptory,\" an inexcusable gaffe.\n\nAt first I was annoyed with the jury clerks screaming over the PA system. They acted toward the group as if they were military recruits or prison inductees. There's way too much yelling. The marshall who took our group to the 16th floor tried his hand at a drill sergeant impersonation. What a jerk, I thought. Later he calmed down and turned out to be nice enough. I came to realize the jury wranglers coped pretty well with conditions that made everyone miserable. \n\nThe brief trial was monotonous and repetitive. I found myself zoning out a couple of times but I quickly snapped out of it. You have to pay attention. This is serious business. \n\nThe case was air-tight. While the rest of us sat wondering what to do, a young woman brilliantly summarized the case in about three sentences. Another woman suggested a vote by raising hands. Guilty. Without two leaders who seized the initiative, it might have taken us a while longer to get our act together.\n\nAfter the trial, Judge Herndon visited with the jury for a brief informal chat. He's very impressive. As a fellow juror said, \"Now we know who to vote for next time.\"\n\nWe also had a chance to speak to the prosecutor. Dazed by the whole trial experience, I didn't have my wits about me. Later, I realized I should have asked him to thank Crystal Z., the heroic woman who confronted the drunk driver. So I will thank her now. When the near-comatose defendant pulled over on Summerlin Parkway, her ex-husband jumped out and yanked his keys. The community owes both of you a debt of gratitude.","useful":9,"funny":4,"cool":5,"type":"review"}

I bought a package from Teambuy.ca, and the price was much too low to be anywhere near what an RMT would offer, even on special ($29).  I should have known better.\n\nI wasn't exactly greeted -- it was more about providing my coupon information. Once that was done, I was ushered into the room, which was comfortable enough. I wasn't once asked anything about what needed attention, massage-wise. She just went at it. In addition, my package included a half-hour facial, and she never asked a thing about my skin -- sensitivies, likes\/dislikes. Nothing. I'm quite sure I got a fancy application of massage oil for the massage part, and a pre-set , rather cursory routine of basic cleaning, exfoliation and mask for the facial.\n\nDuring the facial procedure, she consistently dropped towels (that she was using for her hands) on my feet as I lay under the drapings. Over and over again.\n\nThe one thing I quite liked was the heated bean bag that she put on the back of my neck. Until she kept moving it by dropping it from place to place on the massage table, to get it out of the way so she could work on an area. Just move it gently, please. \n\nSo unfortunately, I cannot recommend this spa (which also sells, of all things, denim jeans).","useful":3,"funny":2,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

The waiting area and bathroom are a little shabby but the spa room was warmly decorated and the facial and massage were great. Based on my first experience I would have given the place a rating of 4 stars.\nHowever my boyfriend and I went back to the spa last week for a couple's massage and were sorely disappointed. The owner herself is sweet and professional (she called me personally to let me know she wouldn't be there for our massages because she had to go to the doctor's but would be taking care of). The massages by her staff though were not that professional and was pretty disappointing. First one of the masseuse started giggling during the massage, not exactly want you want to hear when you're lying face down on a bed, practically naked. My boyfriend commeted afterwards that it made him a little self concious. Second most of the massage was spent rubbing in oil. Both masseuses used up most of the time just rubbing body parts rather than giving the sorely needed deep massaging both our bodies needed. Thankfully our second visit was a voucher deal, if we were paying over a hundred dollars for those \"massages\" then we would've been more disappointed and complained.\nSo based on the so-so massages my boyfrend and I got I would only give two stars, hence the three star rating.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I loved it! \n\nThe service was friendly, the price was right ($4 for the lunch special), and the food was delicious. It's basically scalloped potatoes (which I haven't actually seen very often in Toronto, except at some pubs) covered in nacho toppings--there's a lot of options to choose from and a few are pretty creative. I went with one of the simpler options with chili and melted cheese. It was delicious! The ingredients were nice and fresh, there was plenty of cheese and it was completely melted (that's important). The potatoes themselves were also great; not too salty but not bland at all, not too crispy but also not too soggy--just right. You have to eat them with a fork unless you really like getting messy--either way, it's delicious. \n\nI plan on returning and trying out some of the other options. If I went to Ryerson I'd probably go here for lunch a lot since the price is right. It also might be a good option for drunk food since they're open pretty late.

I got the Pachula Veggie Deluxe at $7.95 and all but two of my other coworkers followed suit. The other two just got the daily lunch special which was around $4.50.\n\nOverall, interesting concept for a food place. It's not quite scalloped potatoes like others have said; scalloped potatoes are potatoes cooked in milk\/cream with cheese and butter and browned under a salamander or broiler. They're incredibly decadent and rich. Irish Potato Nahcos is basically sliced potatoes with toppings. I was a bit disappointed because I was expecting more of a gooey cheesy yummy mess to be on top of my potatoes and THEN toppings, but it was good nonetheless. \n\nMy main complaint (and my coworkers agreed) was that the portion sizing wasn't really that good for what we paid. With a drink, my \"meal\" cost $10.50 and I'm barely full now; I'm sure I'll be hungry again in an hour or two. This place is generous with the toppings but not so much with the potatoes, which aren't exactly that expensive to begin with. We all finished wishing there was more in our containers.\n\nIf I were to go back (which we probably will for snacks at some point) I would go with the smaller lunch special version. its' definitely not enough for a meal, but it looked WAY more appetizing than the \"meal\" I got and it was only about $4.50 with tax. But I doubt I'll be going back here anytime soon unless one of my coworkers wants a repeat. I'll be more likely to take my $10 somewhere else and get a whole lot more food and have change leftover for dessert.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Brand new clean Toyota Aygo, Â£20 of petrol in the car on pickup to be returned with an empty tank, no problems upon returning the vehicle. \n\nThere was, however, one major flaw with Easirent Edinburgh Airport.\n\nAfter making a booking in advance for ten days car hire of a small vehicle, I thoroughly read the terms and conditions which stated that a Â£500 deposit would be held on my partner's credit card (the name on the booking). However, when I arrived at the Easirent office to collect the car, we were informed that the actual deposit was Â£1250, considerably more than what was stated in the contract. We could reduce this by paying a surcharge of approximately Â£15 a day, which added up quickly for a ten day lease. This charge was non-refundable. If I had known this in advance we could have made sure that Â£1250 was available on the card. Due to it being 9pm we had no way to clear the funds on our card so were left to pay the Â£150 charge.\n\nWhat surprised me the most was the friendly sales assistant who told us about this excess. He said that this happens on a regular basis, customers expecting a Â£500 hold and finding out when they pick up the car that it is actually far dearer. After reading reviews online for other Easirent offices around the UK I know that I am certainly not the only one to experience this. This could easily be resolved by stating these terms clearly in the contract in the first instance. This particular sales assistant mentioned that he has tried calling and emailing the head office about this several times but has yet to receive a response.\n\nThis seems like a shameless way to make customers pay an extra charge. The fact that Easirent have been made aware of this, yet refuses to act on it, is simply beyond me. It seems like a sure-fire way to lose out on customers returning or recommending to friends and family, which will most certainly be the case for me.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

I'd been going to my previous auto shop for years. I used to have to call them the afternoon after I dropped off to ask what was wrong with my car. Then I'd have to wait at least another day, maybe two or more, for them to fix it. I had to rush to get there before 5:30. It was dirty there but hey my car got fixed properly. I didn't actually think you could find a place that would do better, but there is! \n\nI've been going to see Tony and Johnny at Oasis Service Center for several years. Their service is friendly, prompt, and reliable. I've unfortunately spent thousands of dollars with them over the last few years but my car runs great. \n\nHere's why you should go. \n\nThey actually call you within a couple of hours or so to give you the run down. You don't have to let that pool of sweat about what is wrong or what it's going to cost gather too long. They'll actually let you know. \n\nThey will not charge you or encourage you to service items you do not need. They fixed my friend's door for free when she was there for another service. On a recent trip for a break job, they identified a noise coming from what I'd call the appendix of my axle. A rubber piece had broken free and was flopping around making noise. They cut it off for free. He told me not to replace the axle just for that, it isn't vital (like our appendix, get the reference now?). If it vibrates at high speeds, then replace it. How cool is that? He could have told me to replace the axle for that but didn't. \n\nThe prices are reasonable, and my estimate is always accurate. Fair market value for qualified, certified technicians. It does make a difference. Your mom's friend may be able to fix your car, but doubtful he'll do it properly. Trust me on this, you don't want some yahoo digging in to the car just to save a few measly bucks. Don't be such a tightwad, it won't save you in the long run, get y our ride fixed right. \n\nYou don't have to kill yourself to get to them before closing. They have a gas station just one mile away that is open later (til 11 pm I think) that they'll drop off your keys to so you can pick up your car after hours if you ask. You will need to pay with a credit card over the phone for your services in that case, but hey, it makes it easy to drop and pick up! \n\nThey're open Saturdays! I believe they close a little earlier but I've never had a problem getting a repair done on Saturday to avoid the whole figuring out a ride to work thing. \n\nThey're in a bigger location now, and have moved the service department to a spot by the Fry's on Guadalupe and McClintock. I understand they also have a spot in Gilbert too. \n\nSo if you're in need of good, honest car care, this is the place to go!","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

I will not go into detail about that since it has been written about extensively by other yelpers. I will focus on the main dish itself. The succulent Katsu. Most poorly done Katsu are over-fried, dried or under \/ over-battered. The Katsu here was just perfect. Fried just right to be crispy but not dry, with the juices of the pork still intact. Not over or under-battered, battered just right and cooked just right (over-dry and still runny batter are the worst). You can taste the pork through the fried batter. The fried batter does not overtake the taste. Secondly, the sauce. The sauce accentuates the Katsu just right. In short, all elements of the dish compliments each other without overriding each other. End Result? Explosion of taste in your mouth!!! Notable mentions are: the house-made salad dressing, miso soup and the soba but come on, what we really want is MORE KATSU!!! Great place.

I've had numerous fillings performed by him, and I've never had any problems. The procedures were all quick and pain-free, and I've always left with a big, shiny smile :) \n\nIt is obvious that Dr. Kim is skilled at his profession, and he really stresses the importance of preventative care, making sure that I'm brushing and flossing every day. This shows that he really cares for his patients and that his heart is in the right place. \n\nThe entire staff is also very genuine and friendly. The hygienist, Sharon, continuously does an excellent job at cleaning my teeth.

As soon as I made that clear, they didn't seem that interested in dealing with me any further.  I'm guessing the rate of commission for the employee that makes the sale for personal training must be quite lucrative.\n\nGym can be very crowded at times, sometimes ridiculously so.  On the other hand, I went one time at 4AM and there was no crowd!  However, during after work or early morning sometimes it's just too busy.\n\nPerhaps if they reorganized the place so that, for example, the two bicep curl machines were side by side instead of upstairs and downstairs it might help alleviate the congestion.\n\nI used to belong to ClubOne on North Service road.  ClubOne is more expensive than GoodLife, but like they say, you get what you pay for.\n\nI go to two GoodLife locations.  This one is walkable, the other one I need to drive to get there.

When he made a condescending remark about the clothes we were looking at we confronted him about being so rude and ended up walking out of the store because of how disrespectful he was being to us.

Certainly, someone else would have found this little gem by now.\n\nI was supposed to meet a friend here for their \"Underground Screening Room\" event tonight.  Said friend had to cancel out just as I pulled into the parking lot, but I stayed to see what this show was all about.\n\nFive dollars for this show is a bargain.  It's a tiny comics shop in the front, but it's a weird selection of comics.  Not the most realized collection I've seen, but they had quirky, unusual stuff here that caught my eye, and will force me to make a return.\n\nAs I walked to the back, I bought my ticket for the show.  I didn't know what to expect, but they offered popcorn and sodas upfront.  Okay, that was a little cool and a nice touch.\n\nThe show itself?  It was very neat.  This little Bohemian group of almost Vaudeville performers doing magic, dance, burlesque, comedy, and more magic.  It all felt very fresh and just different, like this little secret hole in the wall filled with cool and awesome things.\n\nApparently, these shows are once a month, so I will have to go again.  They also do classic cult sci-fi screenings.  I just missed a vintage Doctor Who marathon (curses), so I decided to add them to my Facebook to keep an eye on their \"Coming Events\" schedule.\n\nWhat a weird, wonderful little thing to stumble upon.  I like quirk, and this place was full of it.  It's nice to see people put so much of their heart into just entertaining the crowd.  It all felt very personal, and the performers seemed to be into mingling with the audience during and after the show.\n\nIt was the best five dollars I've spent in a good while.","useful":7,"funny":1,"cool":3,"type":"review"}

For a Star Trek gathering in Las Vegas, this convention is U.S.S. Enterprise huge!\n\nWas always intending to come to this convention since it's right at home, and present and past intermingling with fans!  Great gathering of nerds and geeks alike!  I got star-struck by folks like LeVar Burton, Marina Sirtis, Brent Spiner, and Jonathan Frakes!  No Picard though this round :-(.  For a nominal fee you could get a pic and auto from each of them!  And these folks were friendly as ever.  Just passing by there were no divas in the house.  Hell, even the original SHAFT, Richard Roundtree was there! *Shut yo' mouth'\n\nLots of convention space and a number of dealers to get your Star Trek swag!  No joke, I bought no Star Trek swag, but scored big time with some Star WARS memorabilia I've been wanting for years.  And paid a pittance for them.  Ha Ha!  It was fun to roam around the hall and see what everyone was offering.  I've been meaning to get to this convention, thanks to Groupon I finally answered the calling!  Only a mere $10 to get in!  Wasn't all that bad considering it's held at the Rio Hotel & Casino every year, fun place to play, see some ladies in teeny bikinis!  Only this trip it was people in Star Trek cosplay, and a lot of folks wearing red shirts.  If you don't know Star Trek, a red shirt in an episode meant you were marked for death!  Later, sucka!\n\nNot the biggest convention I've been to (thanks to San Diego Comic Con) but definitely one of the funnest.  Trekkies and Trekkers (YES there is a difference) abounding everywhere!  After all the passerbys and the requited \"Live long and prosper' hand signal stuff, I was inside the inner sanctum!  It was cool just walking the convention floor and seeing all the amazing stuff I would probably never be able to afford.  Show-used prop phaser, anyone?\n\nBut this convention is about bringing Star Trek to the fans!  And there was a lot of seminars and shows abound.  The highlight of the day for me was witnessing THE SHAT William Shatner and Kate Mulgrew together!  Both Captain Kirk and Captain Janeway on one stage!  It was a great interview between the two, and they kept folks engaged by letting people in the entire hall audience ask any Star Trek related question they wanted.  Really great, great conversation.  \n\nI scored some great swag, learned some new things, and had a ton of nerd fun.  I will be back again, Star Trek Convention!  To boldly go where middle-age, balding men have gone before...","useful":2,"funny":2,"cool":3,"type":"review"}

After a few months it became clear to me that this place is nothing but a money mill designed to fleece the gullible.\n\nI'll start off with the good, as there actually is one thing. Most of the instructors are really good with kids. They make the classes very fun and my son loved them. However that ends the positive portion of this review.\n\nThe thing that pushed me over the edge was after about two months of training my son \"qualified\" to test for the yellow belt. I was given a paper informing me of his great accomplishment and then letting me know I had to pay $60 for the test by a certain date. If we paid ahead of time they generously reduced the fee to $50. \n\nI can't say how many things struck me wrong about this. Paying $60 to test a 4yo for a belt is just ludicrous. And what exactly are we paying for? It isn't the instructor's time, as they cancel all classes during testing week, so the classes we paid for aren't being given. It certainly isn't the $2 worth of fabric used to make the belt.\n\nThis belt test fee prompted me to google and see if this is an industry standard. To my chagrin, but not surprise, I learned the term \"McDojo\" and found that Brandon's ATA fits every single criteria for my new vocabulary word. What is a McDojo you ask? Here is the definition off the McDojo FAQ -- A McDojo is a school that teaches a watered-down and impractical form of martial arts in the name of making money. They place the importance of profit well ahead of teaching anything realistic or credible in terms of self-defense, and are dangerous is the aspect that they send unprepared & often over confident students into a world thinking they can fight when in actuality they have no real fighting skills. Often McDojos teach a lot of bullshido, which is a term used to define deception, fraud, and lies in terms of martial arts.\n\nThe FAQ also lists Red Flags that your school is a McDojo and \"if the school exhibits any of these, even just one, it is a 100% McDojo.\" Sadly Brandon's ATA squarely hit the first two points on the list as well as #3 and and #4, leaving only #5 in doubt.\n\nThey make you sign a contract that locks you into months or even years of payments. They have a ton of belt colors, including the seriously made-up camo belt, as every belt color means more dollars into the belt money-mill.\n\nIronically, even after reading all this on google I was still happy to pay the $125\/month since my kid was enjoying the classes, but was unwilling to pay the testing fee. However they were unwilling to compromise on the belt-testing fee so we quit. In the end it turned out to be for the best -- I describe the new school we found in the last paragraph.\n\nOther incidents and observations about Brandon's ATA--\n\n--My son was rarely if ever corrected on his forms. Even I could tell he wasn't the greatest but he was routinely given a stripe on his belt for the most half-assed form. His effort was good, but his skill was not so stellar.\n\n--A few weeks into our experience we had what the school calls an \"evaluation\" but I would term a \"sales pitch.\" Essentially I was told my son was doing amazing and we should change to the leadership track. We signed up for the student track which is $125\/month for two 30-minute classes a week. Leadership is $175\/month for unlimited (during their scheduled times) one hour classes a week. My son was actually enjoying the school enough at the time that I would have been willing to fork out the $175 until we hit the catch. To do \"leadership\" you are also expected to pony up $700 (!) for a bag of \"necessary\" equipment. I can't believe people will pay that much for a young child. Children have the attention span of gnats and when they decide they don't want to do karate any more you're left with $700 of crap you'll never use again.\n\n--I met another family there who had been conned into pre-paying for their son for a year. And, of course, the predictable happened and he no longer wanted to do karate. The mom told me how they had to drag him kicking and screaming to each class. \"Luckily\" for them they had a younger son who wanted to do karate and the school let him finish out the older brother's contract. But this just goes to show why this school forces you into long term contracts. The whole time we were there they had a sign encouraging you to \"pay off\" your contract for 20% reduction in price.\n\n-- A new child started a couple of weeks before the test week was about to start. He performed the moves of the day in the same uncoordinated and sloppy fashion as my son (actually my son was marginally better) and was awarded not one but TWO stripes on his belt. Did he get two stripes because he was so awesome? I think not. He got two stripes because testing week was nigh and you need three stripes for them to get $60 off you for testing. \n\nMore to say but hit 5001 character limit...","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The watch required repairs several years later and I took it back to him.  He basically priced my repairs so high that he tried to convince me to purchase another watch.  I walked out thinking that their business practices were way to \"shady\" for me and swore I would never be back.  I had that watch repaired for a fraction of the quoted price elsewhere.  13 years later, I still wear that watch. \n\nSo, after my trusted watch technician closed down, I had no other place (in close proximity) to go to other than Canadian Watch Imports at their new location at 392 Spadina Ave.  \n\nI went there rather begrudgingly.  I went to repair my watch band and had a vintage watch which needed the glass replaced.   I dealt with Vic who surprisingly remembered the watch he sold me and even remembered the year.  He offered me a few choices on bands which I found to be average to expensive.  \n\nVic was honest with me when it came to replacing the glass on the vintage watch which he said was next to impossible.  He provided me with a few options and offered his genuine opinion on a replacement.  \n\nI replaced the band on my watch which cost $48.35.  He waived the fee for the 2 steel pins (which he replaced) and 4 cuts in the band to make it fit.  For a grand total of $54.64.  I appreciated the fact that he didn't charge me.   I was still weary that I was going to be hosed somehow.  \n\nI came back a few days later for my vintage watch glass replacement.  He still hadn't completed it, but as soon as I showed up he immediately attended to the repair which took about 10mins.  He did a meticulous job.   That cost me just over $50.  \n\nWe got talking about some of the negative reviews he has had regarding his business.   I really think he is trying to improve his customer service.  He is genuinely concerned about his business reputation, and I learned that he would rather repair watches properly with genuine parts, then use cheap replacements as he identified on my current watch that my 'trusted' watch technician had previously replaced.   In fact I saw him turn away a customer that was insistent that he replace a part on his watch with an alternative part and he refused.  Vic later explained to me that he would rather have a customer walk away then provide an inferior service.  \n\nI'm not saying that he has the greatest interpersonal skills, he's not rude, but it's all business with him.  I think if he were to take his time and talk to customers like he did with with me, people would warm up to him.  He is an intelligent person who takes pride in his work....he just wants to be sure he is going to get paid for it and that can come across the wrong way sometimes.  \n\nWill that be cash or debit?","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I'm writing to express my dissatisfaction with their product and service in hopes that they can either remedy the situation for future customers, or at the very least warn others away.\n\nI bought a watch strap that I was reassured was strong and long lasting. I insisted that I didn't mind paying more, but I wanted a strap to last more than a year. The strap lasted two months (the glue came unstuck that held the fastener).  I returned the watch, with the receipt, and asked for a refund or for a new strap.  (I didn't want to get the same strap as I suspected the same would happen. )\n\nI asked to see another strap (that I was told was worth $49), and I asked to pay the difference (I had paid $44 for the first strap that had broken).   My offer was refused.   \n\nThe salesperson told me that I had got my strap wet (the watch is not waterproof, and so I didn't get it wet) or had sweated on the strap. I pointed out that one does expect to sweat a little on a watch strap, and that it should not cause it to fall apart. In the end the shop replaced the broken strap with an alternative strap that I didn't like, because I insisted that I should get a refund.  Through out the interaction the salesperson was rude and obstructive. \n\nA much better way of dealing with customer (and one that perhaps might let the sales people sleep a little better) would have been to admit that the strap was faulty, apologised to me having to return it, and offered to replace it with the same strap or another, and had me pay the difference if the new strap was more expensive. \n\nInstead, the shop has created another angry and upset customer.  One gets the feeling with this place that they are not being honest, no prices on anything, and they are constantly reassuring you what a deal you're getting. I'd avoid, there are plenty of more reputable places on Bloor Street W.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The watches were: a digital LED matrix watch and a wooden watch that was a present from me. Vic was able to resurrect the ancient digital watch from almost 10 years ago, which has great sentimental value to the BF. Vic was upfront and straightforward about repair costs, and everyone there was welcoming and pleasant. \n\nOn a more human note, the BF had taken an epic fall off his bike on the way there, and they gave him first aid, stuff to clean and bandage his wounds and more bandages to make sure he got home OK.

Pop (aka soda) is typically flat regardless of what kind you get\n2. Drive thru on Fridays is ridiculously long. You cannot even get into the parking lot and resort to parking across the street a the Associate Bank.\n3. They Walleye Dinner is seasonal but is also their 2nd best item on the menu. 3rd would be their chicken tenders which are 100% white meat and VERY fulfilling\n4. Pricey. You can easily spend $20 for two people.\n5. Flavor of the day typically sucks. Sorry. It's rare that I pass by and see a flavor I want to stop and order\n6. Wish they would send out more coupons. Earlier in the summer, they will send out a variety of GREAT coupons you can take advantage of such as by one burger, get the 2nd free. Love it when they dish out them coops. \n7. Not the biggest fan of their fries but they aren't bad.\n8. Boring Salads. Not friendly to dieters!! Be warned. \n\nCulvers is a great family oriented restaurant to eat it.

This must be the torture a parent goes through when asked which child they love more. Unless you ask my parents. It is obvious I am the favorite. I love both of these businesses so much and when it was announced that they would be doing a joint event, I jumped on the chance to be in one of the limited seats available.\n\nYonaka took lead with the menu and Snow Shavery played a vital part in elevating the dishes presented to us. We started with a palate cleanser of lemon shaved ice with frozen grapes. This was a treat during this blistering summer. Next was hamachi dish. I say that I don't like certain foods, but it never stops me from cleaning a plate. Hamachi is one of those fish I tend to shy away from, but good luck tearing the dish from me. The touch of grapefruit helped to mellow out the flavor. The fried bun with mixed seafood salad and fresh pickles were phenomenal. A group of us went back yesterday and it was added onto their happy hour menu. It is worth getting. The next two dishes helped put us all in a food coma. When they spoke about communal dining, I was not expecting a whole sea bass for every four individuals. If that was not enough than a plate of pork belly for every six made me want to take a nap. The fennel and apple slaw that accompanied the fish was amazing. I could eat a whole plate of that by itself. The citrus and pears paired well with the fattiness of the pork belly. I was ready to tap out until the dessert came out. Chocolate ganache with three kinds of strawberries, fried milk, and green tea snow was deadly. I ate mine and began devouring those around me. At the end of our three hour meal, I could not think about food again for the rest of the day. \n\nThank you Yonaka staff for staying until 5am to set up and turning around to serve us at 11am.

After my fantastic first visit to Yonaka, I was so excited to see this opportunity pop up and booked my seat as soon as they were released. We arrived at noon on the dot and were pleasantly surprised to see the sake tasting that was available for us. I have to admit we spent quite a lot of time trying nearly every sake available. This alone was worth the price of admission. \n\nFinally, it was time to take our seats and indulge in a heavenly smorgasbord that was presented to us. They started slow with the chicken yakitori and shishito pepper and mushroom skewers with bonito flakes as an appetizer. Then came our amuse of lemon snow ice with frozen grapes. It was delightful and so light and subtle. Great way to tease our tastebuds for what was about to come. Next was the hamachi which was accompanied with serrano peppers and grapefruit. Nice and spicy but still very refreshing and flavorful. The scallop with melon snow ice was next and it was delicious. Very interesting and innovative dish. The fried bun was insane and blew me away for a bit. This was my second favorite course of the lunch. \n\nThere was a bit of a lull while we waited for our next servings and we took the opportunity to chat with our tablemates and get a few more tastes of sake. Finally, we took our seats again and the next course was presented. The whole Mediterranean snapper arrived at our table and everyone's eyes bulged right out of their heads. We were shocked to see a whole fish for every four people. Fantastic. The skin was spectacular and so flavorful. My favorite dish of the meal. The yucca chips were pretty addictive as well. I could eat these instead of potato chips any day.  Large portions of braised pork with egg, cashews and served with a side of rice and tempura were also served at this time. This is when the gluttony reached a peak. Just when we didn't think we could eat another bite the desserts arrived and they didn't disappoint at all. Green tea snow ice with fried milk, chocolate infused with green tea, balsamic strawberry puree, strawberry paper and milk dust. This was the perfect finale to our four hour brunch. \n\nI can't sing the praises of this event enough. It was beyond my wildest dreams and I can't wait to attend another of these now monthly meals again really soon.

Yes!\n\nI came here on 10\/30\/10 to browse with my sister. I love going into antique stores because #1, the quality of the goods is fantastic because everything is from the days before planned obsolescence. Goods were built to last. #2, The prices are fantastic. I could either go to the Forever 21 and buy $15 cheap-o made in China garbage accessories that will break in two weeks, or get a 60+ year old piece of costume jewelery that will last another 60 years for $10. \n\nWhile I was in the store, two little faces caught my eye. I spotted the most luxurious mink scarf there that I was drooling over. 4 little minks, sewn together. I snapped a quick pic of it and after browsing the store for a bit more, I went on my way. \n\nSince that day, I've looked at that picture a million times, forwarded it to friends, left hints to my family about how I wanted it, but I never made it back to Boulder City. I don't think I've ever regretted not buying something on the spot before, until I saw that scarf. I was terrified somebody else was going to snap it up. \n\nToday 1\/12\/11, my dad, youngest sister, aunt and uncle and I all went out to go visit the dam. I asked if we could go \"visit\" \"my\" scarf at the Antique Depot. We stopped on in after going to the dam and I didn't see the scarf! I went up to the desk, cell phone in hand with the picture of the scarf already up on the screen. I asked the nice lady behind the counter if they still had this scarf for sale. She looked around for about 5 minutes before finding it behind a lot of fur coats. She said they had to put it away because so many people were messing with this scarf. \n\nIt was priced at $75, I asked if the price was negotiable. She said $70, I asked if she'd be willing to go to $65. She said she meant $60, not $70. I was sold. For $64 and some change, the famed mink scarf was mine! \n\nIt looks great, especially for it's age. The lady at the counter said it was from the 1940's making this baby about 70 years old. She said she feels that it's important that these furs are displayed, rather than rotting in the back of a closet or in a box. Somebody a long time killed these animals, they were sold and worn and gotten rid of. It's the least I can do to save these animals from the garbage heap so they can be enjoyed. They did not die in vain. \n\nI will for sure come back to this place because the service and prices are fantastic!","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":3,"type":"review"}

Walking or in a boat- either one will work here.  You approach the cave, not knowing what to expect, and you're pleasantly surprised by the initial experience.  You're going through, enjoying the cave and looking at everything it holds.  Then, you reach a point when you say, \"Is there an end to this thing, or am I going to wind up in Beijing when I get out of here?\"  That pretty much sums up my experience at Antique Depot.\n\nDespite coming from an area of Pennsylvania that is infatuated with antiquing, I've never been.  Sure, I've been to some vintage stores and second-hand places, but nothing that actually specializes in \"antiques\" (which to me, is a loose definition).  Anyway, after stepping out of the car in Boulder City, I found shelter from the heat in the first place that I saw.  I'm not sure what I was expecting before I entered, but I do know I was pleasantly surprised when I made it inside.\n\nYou start off in a small room that houses their most prized pieces.  This is apparent by the uniqueness and quality of these items.  It is even more apparent by the exorbitant prizes.  I'm not sure if the pricing is an accurate reflection of what you are buying since this was my first experience shopping in an antique store, but to me the prices seemed high.  Expect to see paintings, vases, stemware, and old coins in this room.\n\nThen you make your way to a hallway that has several small rooms off to the sides each with a different theme.  Some themes I noticed: dresses and accessories, Christmas, and records and cameras.  There was also a room that had lots of old photographs which I found pretty interesting since most of them came from studios in Pittsburgh.\n\nAs you get through all the rooms down the hall, you then enter another large room that has dolls and toys.  This room was pretty fun since it not only had antiques but also some toys from my heyday that brought back memories.  I considered buying an item or two just for memory's sake, but again found the prices a little high.  So instead, I enjoyed seeing them again and moved on.  \n\nThen I started to get that whole \"where is this place taking me to?\" feeling.  There was yet another hallway to wander down (housing neon signs and artwork) and it lead to some scary backroom.  Ok, so maybe it wasn't so scary but I was growing concerned in this incredibly narrow and impossibly long store.  I was worried I might be in some sort of trap... But instead I just saw some old furniture and cookware and some not-that-really-old books.  There was another little side room that you could look into but was blocked off that held some of the better furniture.  \n\nI finally reached the end and didn't wind up in some underground tavern or time portal!  \n\nIf you're really into antiquing then I would highly recommend you stop here (or the town of Boulder City, really).  There is something interesting for everyone and everything is clean and as organized as it can be.  Again, I'm not entirely sure about pricing since I've never shopped in an antique store before, but to me the prices seemed a little high.  I could definitely be wrong.\n\nFun stop in Boulder City, just make sure you're ready to see some scary old Santa dolls in their Christmas room!  (They could easily give the weak-minded nightmares).","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

We checked out Yelp and some other sources in advance and settled on a couple of places that served pizza as our primary targets. It happened to be a particularly cold evening and before we left the hotel, the kind manager at the front desk suggested a third spot, \"just in case.\" Never having been to the area before, we felt our way, through the strange streets and the increasing chill in the air, to Rue Dante, where our first dinner choice turned out to be a bit upscale for Pizza. While the place seemed pretty busy there also appeared to be plenty of room for at least two more. Wrong we were. As it turns out, all those empty tables and chairs were 'booked', we were told by a very snooty hostess and there was just no possible way we would be enjoying pizza in their very popular spot on this particular Friday night. No worries, because as it turned out, that back up eatery suggested to us on our way out of the hotel was just down the block. On the way, we passed another decent looking place and as we walked with purpose  through the frigid cold Canadian evening we agreed we'd circle back if necessary.   Sure enough, chic hot spot number two - only half full with customers - was also \"fully booked\" and we were SOL once again. The owner was kind enough to send us down the street to yet another place he told us he \"eats at himself\" and of course when we got there, it was completely out of business. Guess it had been a while since he enjoyed their cuisine. At this point we were cold, hungry and starting to feel like we were trapped in a surreal film with food everywhere yet nothing we could eat.  So we doubled back to that place we passed between our first two rejections and sure enough, it too was completely booked. Strike three! How was this possible? It was 7:30 on a Friday night in Montreal and apparently impossible to eat in \"Petite Italie.\"  We had just about given up, as we walked passed the most popular pizza place in town and saw two hours worth of crowd waiting outside in the cold. And it was at that moment we spotted Tratotoria Casa Mia. On the doorstep was a guy wearing an apron and stealing a smoke. Inside 6, maybe 8 folks enjoying their meals and plenty of other unpopulated empty tables. The feel was casual and comfortable, but was there room for us? The nice Italian woman reading her paper at an empty table got up to greet us and before we knew it, our Montreal dinner nightmare was over. Within  minutes, that same Italian woman would be in the kitchen cooking up our meal.\nOur waiter, busy as he was taking care of all the tables, was welcoming, took our order quickly, made sure we got our bread and beverages while we waited and in good time, brought our lasagna and pasta, too.  And much to our surprise, considering how empty this place looked and how no other restaurant in the area would even let us in, the pasta and lasagna were both really good.  In short, this was a terrific little restaurant that apparently is not part of the \"scene\" in \"Petite Itlalie\" which is too bad because the food was terrific, the service was good, the prices were more than fair and the people who run the place were flat out warm and welcoming.\nIf you find yourselves in \"Petite Itlaie\" at some point without reservations, skip the crowds, skip the \"scene\" and skip the most popular joints in the hood and slide into Tratorria Casa Mia for lunch or dinner, instead. It's worth it not to wait.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

It's right across the street from Loews theater on the waterfront.  The place was relatively empty even though it was a Friday during the holiday season.  I was the only one seated at the bar.  The bar is nice enough with a couple plasmas and appropriate amount of black and gold on the walls.  However, the bar itself was a bit sticky.  I was greeted quickly by a nice enough chap who brought me a paper and asked me for my drink order.  I had there iced tea, which was ackwardly served in a small pitcher instead of a glass.  I guess I could see the appeal for some, but I don't drink out of straws and this made it very difficult to drink without spilling.  The iced tea was pretty sickingly sweet.  I only had a few sips.  I ordered a cup of the chicken dumpling soup, which I thought was a bit overpriced.  The soup arrived quickly and had a decent flavor although it was served kind of room temperature and underseasoned. Soup should be served steaming hot.  I also tried the pulled pork sandwich and collard greens.  The pork itself was okay, tender and all that.  However, it was also served relatively cold and underseasoned.  The collard greens looked good with big chunks of hamhocks, however not surprisingly they were served cold and also underseasoned.  The service overall was prompt and the hostess was very nice.  She asked how my food was and I didn't have the heart to tell her the truth.  I might give this place another shot.  I've been told the ribs were good, but I'll have to specify I prefer my meals served hot.  I'm guessing if I go again I should go quickly because I'm thinking this place may not be here much longer due to the lack of customers I saw today.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Some people love it, some people loathe it. I'm in the middle. I can appreciate good Christmas music, but most of it is just too cheery and too cheesy. But, I brace myself every year after the huge Turkey dinner digests for the holiday music season. I patiently wait through the month of December opting to play songs like the Counting Crows' Long December - the best December song ever - and avoiding the radio. \n\nWith all that, I complain about Red Hot & Blue because yesterday, not only did they play the worst Christmas music, they played the worst music tracks I could possibly imagine in a restaurant. They played this awful mix of bad bluesy\/jazzy Christmas music, Jackson 5, Alvin & the Chipmunks, a bad remake of \"My Favorite Things\", and some other ear-bleeding music I didn't recognize. Not only was the selection awful, they played it so loudly that I couldn't just tune it out. The waiter came over and asked \"is everything okay?\" to which I smart-assily said, \"The food is good, but the music is definitely questionable.\" He chuckled and agreed, then walked away. I hoped that it would mean he would end the torture, but he didn't. \n\nI think the food was okay, not the best Red Hot & Blue I've eaten, but it was acceptable. I don't love their BBQ sauces, which is probably the most important part of BBQ. The Beef Brisket had a little bit of fat on it, which I welcomed.  The fried okra side was my favorite part of the meal. Other pros: our waiter was friendly and attentive (except the part where he doesn't turn off the music) and the water comes in this small pitcher, per person, which is the amount of water I typically need with dinner. \n\nPerhaps I would have liked the food more if I wasn't trying to inhale it so quickly. Who could blame me though, the music was an alternate form of torture. \n\nNote to restaurants, the music you play does count for something. Choose wisely.","useful":3,"funny":3,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

We were excited about the food - especially the burritos. We were careful to arrive at 8p because we saw that the groupon was not valid during happy hour (from 6 - 8p). \n\nWe arrived and there was no one there to seat us. Most people were drinking but there were three or four tables of people eating food. We wandered in and found a seat at the only table available, which was dirty. Finally, a disaffected server wandered by and inquired: this your glass? Why would we have just one, half-full glass of water between us on a table? \n\nThat aside, he offered to take our drink order and we asked what was good. He didn't have anything to suggest; he just said \"we can make whatever.\" We asked for a drink menu and when he brought it back he told us that the kitchen was closed. We were surprised and he said that they'd run out of food. They had only opened two hours ago and they'd already run out of food? He didn't apologize at all - just matter of fact: kitchen's closed.\n\nWe were very hungry so we decided to go eat at Plum instead and come back for drinks, which is what we told the server. He had no real response, except to say \"ok.\"\n\nWe returned about an hour later to find a surprise cover of $3 each. We weren't happy to have to pay a cover for a place we'd never been to (I'm not a big fan of jazz, anyway), but we paid it anyway. There were no tables available, so we sat at the bar, which was covered in spilled beer (which we cleaned up with the napkins available - no help from the bartender). The bartender was quiet and didn't seem to have much personality -- we asked for a drink menu but there were no cocktails listed (perhaps the menu was missing a page?), so we looked them up on their website ourselves.\n\nMy drink was overly sweet and cloying: I suppose I should have expected that from a drink with blue curacao - my mistake. The bartender couldn't remember my friend's order and so she ordered it twice. Her drink was literally the worst martini either of us had ever tasted. He forgot the olives and when he finally brought them after a second request, they arrived on a cocktail napkin.\n\nFresh food was rolling out of the kitchen at a rapid pace - nearly half of the tables were eating freshly cooked food. No mention of the missing food from earlier and no offer for a menu (not that we would have eaten, but it made me wonder if those with groupons were not offered food for some reason). \n\nTo make matters worse, the beer tap sprayed beer backwards every time the bartender pulled a beer, resulting in beer on our faces and clothes.\n\nTo sum up? This place is amateur - if I didn't know better, I'd say they'd just opened up a few weeks ago and hadn't gotten into their groove (having enough food in stock to go more than two hours of business without running out of food, having all of their menus consistent, having a clean establishment). But the reality, judging from some of the existing comments, is that they've been open for long enough to know better.\n\nThe drinks were over-priced ($10.50 for a martini? Not when you forget the olives and serve it with a lime!), the service is inexplicably bad and downright dismissive, and the food -- as delicious as it may have looked online and at other people's tables -- was mysteriously not available to the likes of us. Add that with a my-excrement-doesn't-stink attitude out of a bar\/restaurant that looks to have been designed by my four-year old niece, and you've got yourself an experience to be sure.\n\nWe certainly won't be going back to AVA and I recommend you steer clear, too.","useful":1,"funny":2,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

This place beats most indoor play zones in the USA. The only thing that deters me from visiting more often (and makes this review a 4 instead of 5 stars) is the price for admission. However, as ANNE MARIE J stated (kudos!), it's much cheaper to go in the afternoon. I personally prefer children activities earlier so that we have the rest of the afternoon and evening to do as we please without worrying that the kids are getting restless from extra energy. Perhaps one day I'll try the afternoon visit before we leave Germany.\n     Our youngest really enjoys the water play area from which he gets soaking wet. Our older two play in the jungle gym area and the slides most of the time. The great thing about this place is the ability to relax in the lounge area. It has couches for a more comfortable seat while you read a book, work on your laptop, or just dose off for a bit. \n     The cashless system is great, but it's an easy way to run up a bill if you're not careful. It's easy to keep ordering from the coffee shop, eating pastries, or splurging on limitless pizza for the kids. The pizza is actually pretty good. Now that the kids are a little older, we can let them run around freely until it's time to go. \n     Definitely plan on a 4-hour (or longer) visit when you're here with kids. They do also host dance parties on a regular basis. If you 'like' them on Facebook, you will see their upcoming events on your newsfeed. CAVEAT: nocturnal events are for adults only.\n     Enjoy! =)","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Lots of parking available which was easily marked with signs and\/or staff directing you.  For the elderly there was golf carts for assistance in getting to the facility if they parked too far.\nSome parts of the Surprise campus was under construction which meant walking on dirt pathways into the facility.\nDress is casual which for me I thought unusual.  Call me old fashioned but I thought we had to dress up for church as a sign of respect...oh well, I guess the times have changed.\nStaff\/employees was super-friendly and welcoming.\nBefore heading into the auditorium for the mass, there's a small bookstore\/gift shop and a small cafeteria that serves breakfast, lunch and coffee\/tea.\nThe auditorium was small but they informed the congregation that they were expanding so the small surroundings was only for a short time.\nMusic is loud, live, on-stage, uplifting and broadcasted on screen for everyone to sing along.  Although there are some staff that come upon stage to talk, the main message is usually conveyed on screen and pre-recorded which was a bit of a turnoff for me as I expected a live on-stage presentation (-1)\nAs for the on-screen message, I too wasn't impressed (-1) as I was expecting the presenter to take a verse from the Bible, take it apart, examine it, and apply it to everyday living but that wasn't the case as they talked about a central theme - as of writing this, the theme they discussed for this week was on Wisdom.\nNewcomers weren't expected to tithe but it does seem that the church expects 10% of one's salary for tithing from what I've read on their site.\nThere's no formal confessional booth so I'm guessing one was supposed to confess personally then choose to accept their communion which was passed around on a platter rather than coming up the aisle as in a Catholic church.  The platter that is passed around consists of small bits of crackers (didn't resemble wafers) and small cups of grape juice.\nMass was held for an hour with homework given.  Another turnoff for me was the pushing of social media (like Tweeting on Twitter about your homework readings given) by the presenter on-screen. (-1)\nAfter mass, newcomers were welcomed to approach the welcome desk where they were asked to supply their address, email, and phone number.  I only supplied my address and email and have noticed that I have started getting both mail and email which I had unexpected, yet another turnoff.\nVery questionable if I'll be coming back to nourish my soul here.","useful":3,"funny":3,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

I had seen his name mentioned several times among a local mom's group I belong to, so I figured it was worth trying out.  \n\nBetween our family of 4, we made roughly 4 visits within two weeks.  Visit 1 was for myself to check out the office and have a cleaning done.  Dr. Yoon and his staff were awesome.  I had my two year old with me, and they even set up a table for her to color at and put some cartoons on TV.  Visit 2 was a check up for my husband.  He was really pleased with his visit and how quick he was done and off to work.  Visit 3 was for both of my kids (one is 5 and one is 2).  They LOVED Dr. Yoon and his staff.  My 5 year old is still talking about his time in the office and how fun it was.  Visit 4 was for me (again).  Had to have a cavity filled and molds taken for a night guard. The staff anticipated I would have my daughter with me and they had the coloring table and cartoons all set up for her when we arrived.  Seriously... they are that thoughtful and kind. \n\nWe genuinely loved our dentist back in the Midwest and I was dreading having to find someone new.  Dr. Yoon unknowingly had some big shoes to fill and he and his employees did it amazingly well.  Every single person in that office clearly cares about every single client they have. We are so glad to have found such an awesome FAMILY dental office in Scottsdale!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

The inside is IMMACULATE with white marble tile floors, beautiful lighting (including edgy lighting and a gorgeous traditional chandelier), two large buffet lines (only one was in use while I was there), new seating, crisp, and so clean you could have probably eaten off their floor.\n\nSecond-it smelled AMAZING. I was a little put off since we were one of three tables seated at 7 on a Saturday... but didn't let that bother me long. The servers were so friendly and sweet-and once we ordered (Hibachi chicken and steak, raw for me; hibachi chicken for my friend), we went to the bar-where you could have all-you-can-eat salad\/pasta, soup, AND dessert! (and the desserts weren't whimpy-they had traditional Japanese cheesecake (ha ha that's clearly a joke), cookies, various puddings and icecream.)\n\nWe ate our salads (and the salad wasn't iceberg-I had mesculin mix and my friend had romaine), and our soup (they had two kinds: I got the traditional onion and she had the potato). Our meals came out on HUGE plates, sizzling hot. More than I could eat in TWO meals. And so good! The rice was cooked perfectly, the mixed vegetables also (cooked but still slightly crunchy), my steak was rare, and the chicken was so succulent it was like eating a forbidden fruit. I'm not exaggerating too much!\n\nThey brought out the shrimp and ginger sauces in squeezable containers (like you'd find mustard and ketchup in). Worked for me! I didn't have to ask for more, which I usually do at a Hibachi place.\n\nSo-I got all-you-can-eat salad\/soup\/dessert AND delicious Hibachi that I made two meals out of... for $8. EIGHT DOLLARS! How can you afford not to love this place? The food was FANTASTIC Hibachi!\n\nOther notes: They DO serve beer, serving traditional Japanese beers and a few domestic. They also had plum wine! They DO have a TV. I happened to be there while the Masters were on. They DO have a lot of room. Could serve huge groups. They DO have kid friendly food.\n\nAll in all-TRY THIS PLACE!

Outside of business is unkept - very tall weeds surround the building and the grass is a couple of weeks overdue to be mowed.

No friendly greeting when we were acknowledged, just \"how many\" and \"follow me\".  Once seated, we had to wait for a long time for our waitress to come over - she was shooting the breeze with a 'regular'. When she took the order, it was short responses at best. And when I didn't say the type of bread, I received a very curt \"what type?\"  When the food was brought out, it was plopped on the table and the waitress walked away.  Nothing about whether we needed anything else.  Had to flag her down for A-1 - I ordered steak and eggs, so being asked about this should have been automatic, I would have thought. When I looked at my food, most of the home fries resembled grizzle and the eggs, which should have been over easy were much closer to scrambled. The toast was heated bread.  Could have complained, but didn't bother.  The waitress did ask later how everything was and when I said \"so-so\", she didn't seem overly concerned and didn't ask anything else - just going through the motions.  When we checked out, she didn't even ask how it was.  She just took the bill, said the total and we paid.  No thank you, nothing.  So...with all of the other options in the area for good \"home style food\", why on earth stop here?

The fruit in here is very hard to resist, they have a huge selection and everything looks amazing, you won't see many bruised old 'nanas here and that's what I like to see.\n\nThe downside however, is the price. Fruit is expensive wherever you shop but it's more so here, I guess it's because it's of such a high quality and I get that but why on earth is it so darn expensive to stay healthy? It's just annoying and something else I can add on my anti fruit list.

I spoke to Brian and he said he would have a technician come to my house to attempt a repair. The technician came out the next day...a Friday at 5:30...looked at it and left his card under the wiper with a note saying the chip was larger than a 50-cent piece and not repairable. He didn't even have the courtesy to knock on the door to talk to me or my husband face-to-face. I called Brian on Monday to see if he could explain how it's not repairable, so he said to bring the car into their shop. When I got into the car the chip had an 8-inch crack splintered off it so I knew at this point it wouldn't be repairable. He quoted me a replacement cost that was about $75 more than who I ended up going with. \n\nLong story short, I will never go back to Deals again.

When a resto cuts too many corners or does it too brazenly (say, by mixing milk with the already-cheeseless bleu cheese side to buffalo wings... God...), sometimes it'll make or break whether or not I go there again.  Because, you know, when you love to cook, you notice that kind of thing.  \n\nBut then there are those places that completely surprise you, places where you can't help but smile when you compare both expense and expectation with what it is you've received on your plate.  Such was my eye-opening, palate-happy experience with Yummy Bar-B-Q.\n\nIt isn't a feast for the eyes, and the truth is that the slightly beaten-down look of the place kept me away for a while before I finally crossed the threshold.  The sloppy, hand-scrawled signage along the walls and the intimidating enclave that hides the kitchen from the dining area definitely kills any sense of ambience making this a date-worthy joint... but the food.... whoah.\n\nI was grabbing a fast lunch during my workday, and was stunned to get a fabulously spicy mountain (mountain, I tell you) of chicken, stirfried veggies, and nutty Korean rice for about five bucks.  Yeah, you read that right.  And for another buck or two, I could have added tofu and traditional kimchee to my plate, even though what I already was looking at was enough to feed two.  \n\nSimilar lunch specials are available with beef, pork, squid, shrimp, or simply vegetarian.  Dinner entrees feature a variety of barbecued dishes (all of the above meats plus charcoaled mackerel), plus the noodle, rice, stirfry and other dishes that might expect from an Asian resto.  No entree is priced above twelve bucks, making this ugly but delicious spot a choice locale for the budget-conscious, spice-loving foodie.  \n\nAnd they serve beer.  Ooo.","useful":1,"funny":2,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

The beef dumpling soup is delicious and very good portion. Taste is light enough to my liking and doesn't taste like msg. My only complaint is with the rice cake. I thought they added too little fish cake and noodles but it's not a big deal to me. Taste is just like any other generic restaurant's rice cake (it tastes good).\n\nThe atmosphere is your typical mom & pop feeling you find in Korean restaurants. I generally don't care about atmosphere so I'm being neutral here. I like to pay for good food, not the atmosphere. \n\nOverall, the food doesn't really stand out. It's highly edible.

(Unless morbidly curious...)\n\nOur somewhat stunted little province is rife with these mysteriously expensive food chains that serve this flavorless & nutriionally-bereft quasi-food garbage. Service was helpful to my inquiries; I ordered a chicken burrito, and the toppings actually looked fresh made if the tortilla didn't (it was on the verge of cracking). Way too much in a hurry to assemble and not properly heat through, though there was little solid food in it to heat I guess. The smattering of chicken tasted re-heated and salty, the sauce toppings weren't bad but the fresh veggies & particularly the onions tasted stale, stale, stale. The 'cheese' was barely present in flavor and may as well have been (or was it actually?) colorful wax shavings sprinkled on the somewhat miserly contents that altogether did not really satisfy.\n\nI did get through said pathetic 7-dollar burrito, and though that was a rip off there was at least a sale this week (um, the deal gets worse?). But if this is what 'gourmet' fast food has become, I'm opting out. What a ripoff. Seems like the place was designed by yield managers whose sole and soul-less aim was to empty your wallet cynically & efficiently allowing the least imaginable enjoyment or health benefit possible.\n\nQ: Is it THAT hard to make decent cheap TexMex takeout east of the DVP? Burrito Boys on Peter Street kicks this place in the keister. People are not stupid, you know and the Beach has its share of doubters when it comes to eating out down the block.

It doesn't know whether it is an office, (the manager's desk is in the dining area.) a cafe, an ice cream parlor or a kitschy antique store.\n\nThe store had no real antiques, just the sort of craft work one generally finds at the swap mart.\n\nThe menu is that of a brunchery with french toast, omlettes, egg dishes and baked goods. Sounded good. Unfortunately the execusion is where this cafe fell flat.\n\nThe sausage and cheese omlette was obviously microwaved instead of being prepared in a pan on a stove, topped with a single slice of American processed pretend cheese. The french toast tasted very much like it was taken from the freezer and popped in a toaster. \n\nBacon and sausage were of the lowest order, the bacon being so thin you could have read the paper through it and possesing no actual flavor at all.\n\nThe promised \"homemade\" biscuits were such a disappointment that they went unfinished. I have had better biscuits at McDoanlds. Honestly, and McDonalds makes dreadful biscuits.\n\nOverall we were extremely disappointed in this little cafe and became even more so when the check arrived. The total price for this disaster was almost the same as if we had gone to a real resturaunt  but without any thing that approches the satisfaction one gets from dining on good food. The waitress\/cook\/manager very cheerfully gave us discount coupons for our next visit, we left them sitting on the table.\n\nThe food was actually so disappointing and we ate so little of it that we  then went someplace else to have our breakfast.\n\nIf you're hungry and are thinking about stopping by The Apple Dumpling Cafe for a bite, I recommend McDoanlds, the food will be cheaper and NOT microwaved, and be moderately better tasting.\n\n*******************************************************************************\n\nWell, a few days after posting this review I received a meesage from an owner of Apple Dumpling Cafe and after due consideration I thought I'd add my response to that message here as well. I will use their statements then respond to them, promotional comments have been edited out. Also I should like to point out that the location we visited is now closed and they have a new location in Queen Creek.\n\nADC: \"We have been in the Restaurant and catering for 25 years.\nYes everyone has some off days. At Apple Dumplings, we cook everything up fresh, no cooking items and keeping them warm. Fresh eggs, not powdered or liquid eggs.\"\n\nDBABH: Now between my wife and myself we also have nearly 20 years of restaurant experience, everything from family dining all the way up to 4 star restaurants. We know what good food tastes like, this wasn't it.\n\nADC: \"Maybe you are not used to baked biscuits instead of warmed microwave ones.\"\n\nDBABH: Being a native of the west I have had my share of delicious, tender and tasty biscuits from campsites to local restaurants and no, the biscuits at the Apple Dumpling Cafe do not qualify. They were of poor quality and neither tender nor tasty.\n\nADC: \"Our business is growing in Queen Creek. Our Apple Burger has been called one of the best in the country by many.\"\n\nDBABH: I am sure the business is growing and that is a good thing. But the new location is far enough out to discourage this reviewer from giving them a second chance at the apple. Perhaps if I were in Queen Creek one day for another reason I might stop in, but given the low quality of food we received on our first visit I think the odds of that happening are long indeed.","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

On this and previous vacations here we have enjoyed eating our breakfast al fresco at the pool cafe. However, with the addition of the City Center complex and thanks to a line at the pool cafe we have found a new favorite for breakfast at Silk Road in Vdara. It is simply one of our very favorite places for breakfast EVER!!!  \n\nWe just ate there the past three mornings-phenomenal!  I can't say enough good things about it and the waitstaff- a different one each day and they were all The French press coffee is smooth and perfectly brewed.  We had omelettes the first day with pastries and the tropical fruit. The omelttes were solidly good and the tropical fruit excellent with beautiful presentation and a decadent side of sweet tahini yogurt. There was even a half of a fresh lilikoi (passion fruit)!  \n\nThe second morning we again shared a continental breakfast with pastries, juice, and coffee along with the tropical fruit.  I chose the morning sliders-two small tenderloin sandwiches and a third sandwich as a take on bacon, egg, and cheese all on brioches. Wow!!!  My husband had the turkey hash which was also fabulous!  It is a hash of turkey and potatoes but with an alluring blend of Turkish spices and topped with two eggs.  Soooo tasty! \n\nThis morning we had the same as yesterday except I tried the signature Eggs Eggs Eggs dish and my husband opted for egg whites scrambled on top of his hash. The Eggs Eggs Eggs dish is a trio of takes on classic egg dishes-a poached egg atop the turkey hash topped lightly with hollandaise, a fried quail atop a tasty fried (but not greasy) potato cake, and scrambled egg served in a shell upon steamed spinach all topped with a light salt foam.  Oh boy!!!  \n\nOverall everything was get-it-again worthy. Can't wait to eat breakfast here again on future trips!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Top shelf Vodka, Blue Curacao, pineapple juice and Madori.  A couple of those while you wait and you won't care if your table ever becomes available.  It's the best drink I've ever had - hands down! \n\nIt's somewhat difficult to \"pigeon hole\" Primadonna from their menu perspective.  Definitely has an Italian influence but also has a distinct Asian feel to it as well.  Suffice to say though, their menu is quite diverse and full of unique items and combinations to suit any palate.\n\nI have dined there three times, twice with a large party and each time we ordered the huge sushi boat. It was fabulous!  Even if sushi is not your cup of tea, you just may like the sushi at Primadonna. \n\nThe third time was a party of four and I ordered the grilled salmon.  It was excellently prepared and came with some corn salsa, rice and beans.  I was a little surprised by that combination but let me tell you, it all works together.  It was very good!\n\nThe atmosphere at Primadonna is current.  It's got almost a club vibe to it and is a very entertaining place to eat.  The last time I was there (party of 4), we got a table overlooking the sidewalk.  It was a beautiful summer night, the large picture window was open and it was almost like dining Al fresco.  \n\nThe service is phenomenal.  Each time we were there, we had a different server and, while each had their own unique personality, all were not only competent, but FUN!  It seemed they were having as much fun as we were but ALWAYS got it right when it came to service.\n\nMy only regret is that I live in the Chicago area and don't get to Montreal near enough.

He also went through our wills and trust after they were created and made sure we understood what they said in plain English.  \n\nI had originally tried to set up our wills\/trust using two different Will-maker software kits, but I had so many questions they didn't answer.  I didn't feel like I really knew what I was doing.  Even though going to see an actual lawyer is much more expensive, I feel like it is well worth the money.  John was very thorough and made sure we were covered at every angle in our trust.  He made us think about things we had never thought of before--such as incapacitation.  I don't remember the will-maker software even mentioning that (maybe some do but the ones I used didn't).  He also wanted to make sure our trust was as tax-efficient as possible.  I highly recommend John if you want the peace of mind that your children and family are going to be okay should something happen to you and your spouse.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Another person sitting near me ordered the personal pizza (they dont call it pizza though).   Be prepared because it is tiny and looks more like an appetizer than a meal.

This place is a must stop for any grocery shopping list.\n\nThe most obvious advantage to Aldi is the price... groceries here are, overall, much cheaper than anywhere else.  There really are some ridiculous deals here.  Orange juice, cheese, canned goods, and produce are especially cheap.  They only sell so called off brands of things, but they all taste just as good as the overpriced name brands.  The produce generally looks pretty good, though definitely take a look over the packages of peppers, tomatoes, and onions as occasionally there can be a rotten one hiding inside.\n\nThe biggest drawback is the lack of selection and the ever changing selection... The selection is small as the stores in general are small, but they use the space wisely with stuff packed in on stacks and pallets and little shelving.  The stuff they sell tends to change often, which can be frustrating when you can't find that awesome thing you found last time.\n\nCheckout is a bit odd here as well.  First, you have to put a quarter deposit down to get a shopping cart.  This is not really much of a hassle, but is just strange... I don't see the purpose other than making sure people return their carts to get their quarter back.  Also, they don't have paper\/plastic bags at the checkout, so bring your own, buy one of their cloth bags, or be prepared to have a trunk full of loose groceries.  The cashiers here are very efficient... maybe too much so.  They really move fast, just kind of throwing stuff into the cart at the end of the checkout with little regard for glass or squishable items like bread or produce.  That being said, none of those are major problems.\n\nI go here pretty much every week for much of my grocery needs.

It has its own lot, so don't worry about parking! \nAs you enter, have your CCSD badge ready and check in to the left. If it's your first time signing in you simply let them know and they'll let you fill out a form at the desks to the right and get you into the system! Once you sign in, they go over the points and donation system. \n\nBASICALLY: you start with 100 points (everything here is \"paid with points\". To get more points, you donate. $25= 500 pts, $50=1000 points. And YES if you don't use all of your points, you can still use them throughout this school calendar year).  I ended up going through the isles getting a BUNCH of items for my classroom, my students, as well as myself! Fortunately they also have donated posters that are free (no points needed) that you can take so take advantage of those as well. \n\n**The only downfall is that you may have to pay attention to signs that say *limit ___* meaning you can only take a limited amount, but come on.

We were looking for an instructor & school that offered a class that was not only sufficient enough to satisfy Nevada State requirements for a Concealed Carry permit, but one which was informative, exceeds that criteria, fun & at a competitive legit price rate. My buddies came across 3 Dot Sight Group, owned by Eric P. Kelley. We decided to contact him and inquire regarding the who, what, where, when, why & how investigative questions & to our surprise he catered to us with open arms in a respectful and exciting manner. He wasn't trying to sell us, as he offered insights and questions of his own in which he wanted to find out what we were looking to get out of the class. Since we were a group of 12, he offered the class at $70.00 per person which includes 8 hours of classroom training, Nevada law, real life scenario, what to do incase you are involved in a shooting, ways to ensure liability issues, safety & inspection of fire arms, fire arm handling\/stance, actual range time for the shooting portion and the written test & much more! Mind you this class is for Nevada\/Arizona conceal carry permit. For additional carry states it is a little more & more in depth.  \n\nWe took our class on Saturday January 23, 2016 & had 3 instructors: Tim, Mike & Eric...all of who are wonderful characters in their own way. All 3 were very knowledgable with years of background in law enforcement & military. Big Mike is a little intimidating at first but Iike big soft bear, you don't want to mess with him, but very nice when you know what he is all about. Class room is small in a room that could fit approx 20 students if need be. I think it is an excellent size considering the more personal level and attentiveness acquired both ways through instructor and student. All in all, it was a great & interesting experience. Our group had a fun time and even plan to take additional continuing education\/class skill levels. I would highly recommend 3 Dot Sight Group and Eric if you are looking into getting a CCW permit or if you just want to be informed with anything firearms.

WEll, I can understand that. Our youngest had a couple of good size scratches the first time she went there and you know what, thats normal! They are dogs for crying out loud. Dogs are animals, not your children, although we are as close to ours as if they were. People need to realize that dogs have sharp teeth and like to wrestle and play rough. \n\nLet them be dogs! It took us a couple times to come to this realization as well. But now we 100% accept the fact that our youngest who loves to roughouse, loves to wrestle and play is almost always going to have marks on her. That is not the fault of the kennel operator.\n\nAnother idea for people who don't want their dogs interacting with other  dogs is to checkout Petsmart. Sure they will charge you twice as much and the 18yr old kids that work there often forget to feed your dogs but at least you won't have to worry about them running around.\n\nOh yea the fact Liz puts up videos on Facebook everyday is a HUGE plus for us.

Not exactly a five star club and minus a star for the lack of air on the dance floor. But overall it's a good place to get your dance on. \n\nI gotta say I do love the dance floor since it lights up and it's good to at least see what you're stepping on and how icky the dance floor can get with spilled drinks, a tampon, straws, and someone's broken heel... ok ok kidding about the heel but i digress. lol. \n\nI like that you can roam around, upon entering the club you see the craziness and crowd of ppl by the bar and dance floor which are surrounded by booths and stripper poles situated between the booths. You also notice on the walls two big screens where music videos play of the song that everyone is dancing to. There's also a second floor in which there are two ways to get up there, either by the winding stairwell outside or the back stairwell which leads you to a dark hallway by the restrooms. It's pretty nice because you can roam be like a creeper. \n\nNow, i've been to countless clubs and know a thing or two of navigating through a crowd to get close to the bar or get in the middle of a dance floor to get at least some shoulder room. The same rules apply to Disco. The bar is crowded by the entrance but as you get through the first two waves of ppl there's room to the bar to get a drink. Prices are reasonable by Scottsdale standards. Crowd is very low key and not as douchey unlike the patrons found down the street at PCL, DP, and Axis. And it's a mixed crowd as well. DJ plays a good mix, and overall a fun fun place to just dance. Of course my complaint at this DISCOtheque is the lack of circulating air. It seems the air vents are by the bar area and entrance. I think it wouldn't be too unreasonable and gaudy if fans were in place to at least alleviate the hotness permeating on the dance floor. Also, would it hurt to at least have a few more go go dancers... hot guys and girl dancers are not a bad thing. Just saying. But I like overall vibe, no cover, reasonable drinks, and good music makes this a fun stop in the old town circuit on Sat. nights.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Back in November of 2014, I somehow tweaked my back at the gym. I began to experience lower back pain that made it hard to sit comfortably. After a week, I scheduled a visit to a chiro (not Banks) who immediately began \"treatments\". This doctor never offered a consult or took an x-ray. After two months of visits, sometimes twice a week, the pain worsened. Many nights were spent not sleeping and getting out of bed became a chore. It felt as if my lower back was severely tight and all twisted it up. Bending down to tie my shoes was beyond difficult. After one day spending 20 minutes of trying to get out of my car to go in to work; I knew something had to change!\n\nI googled, found Pinnacle and took a chance. Upon my first visit, Dr. Banks sat with me and provided an in-depth consult along with treatment options. I expressed my fears of being side-lined with chronic back pain; in which he reassured me he'd do everything he could to remedy the pain. After an x-ray and my first treatment, he gave me the best course of action and promised that within a month, he'd like to see my back at 100% with little or no further visits. After a month of weekly treatments, my back was back to normal. No pain whatsoever!! I was able to walk, bend, sit, stand and sleep---PAIN FREE! To me, it was nothing short of a miracle. The best part? No further visits were required. It is now June of 2016 and I'm still pain free. I recommend anyone with back pain to consult with Dr. Banks. He's extremely knowledgeable and he and his staff CARE. Thank you for all you've done!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

They did not ask me anything about my previous medications, what I am taking, if I have any allergies  (and I have a severe allergy) and if I was even pregnant which I clearly was showing.  When I went to pick up my medication the cashier just handed it to me without providing me any information on the new medication.  Most importantly, without providing me any medication, there was not even a sticker on the bottle indicating it must be consumed on an empty stomach and no grapefruit no warnings, nothing spoken to me, just handed it to me.  I had to do research myself when I got home since they did not provide me any information. I felt I was at McDonald's getting fast food, not a drug store where a medication can kill me.

So many people in the beaches are complaining about this especially those with strollers, walkers, scooters or wheelchairs you cannot get down an aisles. Complaints have been raised to the manager but nothing has been done yet.  Hoping someone from head office pays a visit and tries walking down each aisle and put yourself in someones shoes. Get a measuring tape out and measure, each aisle is clearly different widths and each aisle gets smaller and smaller as you go east, who designed this?  The architect should have caught this error especially if it does not meet code. Even strollers cannot get by, it is not right for a brand new store not to meet AODA compliance.  A helpful hint is if you walk sideways and shimmy and try not to hit all the structures they  placed in the middle you may be able to squeeze by but only if nobody happens to be in the aisle. If there is, you will have to wait. I have been in this store 5 times since and each time I hear numerous complaints from other customers about this but nothing is being corrected, they just keep adding more crap in stands in the middle of aisles.\n\nThere are plenty of other independent drug stores in the area where the pharmacists takes the time to explain your medication to you as well as asks you questions about what you are presently taking and treats you like a patient not  number and you can actually fit down the aisle.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

There were four women working, but none of them acknowledged my presence when I entered the (very small) shop. One of the ladies was blocking most of the counter (standing on the customer side) and it took her some time to realize that I couldn't see what to order due to her standing in the way. As I was leaving, she proceeded to block me from exiting as she picked up some sort of... bug, I think? from the ground inside the shop and placed it not far from the entrance outside.\n\nMy whole in-store experience was just strange and I look forward to returning to eating the treats that my coworkers provide, not picking them up myself.","useful":1,"funny":3,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

I swear by everything, I would not use this shuttle company even if it was FREE!!!\n\nPurchased Shuttle Passes ($30 for one day) over the phone at approx 2pm and was advise to go to Palazzo to pick up the pass and be picked up there.\n\n-Upon arrival, there were no signs leading to the shuttle pick up area. Seriously impossible to find. I probably wasted a good 15 minutes trying to find it.\n-Started lining up for shuttles at 645pm more or less (with ~80 people ahead of me) and was informed shuttles were running late. \n-First shuttle did not arrive until approximately 730pm, but to our surprise, they were MINI Shuttles! They shuttles could only hold 25 people with some sitting on the floor. How ghetto!\n-Second shuttle came at approximately 815pm, and my fiancee and I knew we had to get on this bus or we'll never get to the festival. We got and assumed all our troubles were over. The driver didn't know how to get there or even worse, where the 15 Freeway is!!! The 15 is the main freeway in LV and if you can't find that freeway you're screwed\n-3hours and 50 minutes later due to poor planning by 1NS we were still not at the event. My other friends who took the Insomniac (EDC) Shuttle got their between 45 minutes and 1hour before we did. Their drivers knew better routes and the fastest way to get there. Since we relied on googlemaps, we instructed the driver the directions we got.\n-At approximately 11:15 PM, the driver had to pull over to urinate. Half the people got off the shuttle and decided to walk 4 miles. The other half including myself remained. However, people on our bus started to use the restroom, so we figured we should leave too, not knowing when they'll be back and our concert started at 7pm!!!\n-Upon walking this 4 mile distance, another 1NS shuttle broke down, go figure!\n-After 2 miles of walking on a road where we shouldn't be walking, I decided to hail for a cab. I did not check into the concert until approximately 12:10AM!\n-Left the concert at approximately 430AM and myself and another 500+ people had no idea where to find our shuttle company. There were no signs posted and people, they will not pick up their phone for you. You'll get transferred to an automated message. Once the sale is done, they'll walk away. After searching for 1 hour and 30 minutes for our shuttle, we luckily stumbled across some people who were also looking for the same shuttle company. I pushed n shoved because I did not want to get stranded there til who knows. My fiancee and I luckily got on the bus and we departed at 630 AM more or less.\n-Due to poor logistics again, we did not arrive back to the Palazzo until 830AM (18 mile drive).\n-I thought we had it bad, but some people had it even worse. They had to sneak onto other shuttles and some were stranded as late as 1130AM without any indication of when their serviced will be rendered.\n\nI have never filed a charge back against a company but I will do for the very first time.\n\nSTAY AS FAR AS AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY. STORIES ARE ALL TRUE. THEY ARE SCAMMERS. OVERBOOKING and claiming they have 8-10 shuttles. They had 4 shuttles running at best. \n\nI would recommend anything over this shuttle company.","useful":3,"funny":2,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

On Sunday, we thought of using them as our ride back to the Strip, but again, we had to find another way. We paid another $20 each to return. \n\nThe man who was dealing with this company said he would be giving our money back but now, he is dodging all phone calls and emails! \n\nThey are THEE most awful company ever!

But if you can make it to the top, you'll find the Vegas valley (and Lake Mead) laid out before you to the South and a great view of the desert wilderness to the North.\n\nGass Peak is located within the Desert National Wildlife Refuge and is the highest summit (6943 ft \/ 2116 m) in the Las Vegas mountain range (mountains that form the north-east barrier of the Las Vegas Valley). The only way to get to the hike is to head north on 95 and turn right onto a dirt road towards Corn Creek (turnoff is near mile marker 101).  Word of warning: you'll need at least a high-clearance vehicle to drive the dirt roads in the Desert National Wildlife Refuge and a 4x4 vehicle is recommended.  Stop at the visitor center and ask for directions to Gass Peak road (marked, but located about 45 minutes down some unfinished, rough and rocky desert roads--so worth some good directions from staff).\n\nOnce you get to the trailhead, you'll face the steepest part of the climb up front--old roads now closed to the public that seem to go straight up and make your thighs and lungs burn.  But push through that and you'll be on a winding trail (sort of -- you're following the marks made by people and animals, rather than a maintained trail).  The trail winds up and around to the ridge of some smaller peaks.  From there, you'll keep walking up and along mountain ridges (always looking west to the cell tower that marks Gass Peak).  Once you're up on top of the smaller peaks, the climb gets easier (although steeper and there's a lot of slipping and sliding on the steeper paths).\n\nBut keep going and you'll reach the peak looking out over the Vegas valley.  There's a log book at the top with people signing in or leaving their thoughts while looking out over a desert metropolis to the South and an almost pristine mountain wilderness to the North.  Best view I've found of Las Vegas and you'll earn the view with all the incline exercise.\n\nAs usual, BirdandHike has an excellent description of the hike and great directions:\nhttp:\/\/www.birdandhike.com\/Hike\/DNWR\/Gass_Peak\/_Gass_Peak.htm","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":3,"type":"review"}

This montra has fueled my lifelong wonderlust. I was born and raised in Las Vegas and always dreamed of climbing each mountain peak that forms the sky line. These peaks have haunted me, beckoned me, and dared me to try their mite. Gass peak imparticilar has called to me like a forbidden siren.\n\nMy great friend Paul W and I developed a plan to summit Gass peak a year ago. There are some Web sites that provide detailed and easy to follow directions to get to the trailhead and ultimately, the summit. We researched as much as we could and set a date. With perfect weather and an early start, a long time goal was about to be reached.\n\nThe 95 to the corn creek turn off was well marked. The road to the ranger station was newly paved. This turns to a rocky dirt road that provides appropriate signage. Take the Mormon wells road to Gass peak road. The mountains and rock formations along the way are visually spectacular and resemble beautiful anger as different minerals and rock have battled for turf rights millions of years ago.  Like a great rock\/earth battle field, you will quickly forget Las Vegas is 40 or so minutes away. \n\nThe trailhead is obvious. It's a service road that you will need to follow to the right. You can gaze upon the summit from the start. It will call to you and taunt you along the way. There are multiple steep stretches of trail and very few flat ones. You travel along the spine of a prehistoric ridgeline that holds on to the view of the LV valley tightly. As you ascend the trail the valley quickly drops and provides a vast view of the diverse and impressive landscape. \n\nThe top gets closer and the trail gets steeper. I would recommend some training before you take the 3.1 mile trail up around 1700 feet. Also water, lots of water. The summit has a large Antena and building with some big solar panels to absorb the plentiful sun and fuel the comm needs of the valley below. There is a nice area to unload, stretch out and take in the great accomplishment of making it to the top.\n\nMy friend, Paul W and I have made many hikes and summits and loaded down our packs to train hard so that we may hunt easy for this particular adventure. As with any summit, it's euphoric to stand atop a mountain and gaze down into the valley below. This summit was even more so gratifying due to the fact I've been looking at this peak for my entire life. \n\nWe ate at the summit and replenished our fuel and enjoyed the view for an hour or two. 360 degrees of great views almost overwhelmed our senses. With great sadness we had to head down and release our grip of the summit victory. The decent back into the valley is equally as beautiful and changes around every draw and corner. Be careful on the steep parts. The trail is well marked and ranges from limestone to jagged rock to sandstone to a volcanic wonderland. It is well worth the effort and a hike I will never forget.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

A dragon whom had snatched a virgin princess whom was never to be seen by anyone again.  In this particular case, there once was a dragon called Gass (Peak).\n\nIn 1996, I arrived in \"The Meadows.\"  When I would eventually get my bearings and properly orientate myself to the valley, when I looked north I spied the monstrosity.  A curious glare would be cast down from above like the eye of Sauron when the sun would hit an angle along it's ecliptic.  I would gaze on high and feel as if the summit called to me.  Better yet........mocked me.  It's taunts beckoned me to slay the beast and rescue the princess.\n\nTime would pass and pass..........and pass.  Every morning I woke up and went about my business anywhere in the valley, when I looked north...there was the beast in all of it's magnificence...scorning me.\n\nAlmost 20 years later, two knights (Zack M. & myself) with the passion of Don Quixote, formulated a plan to slay to giant.\n\nWith one war chariot left at a nearby reservation, the two would take another more robust war chariot to the base of beast, slay it, and rescue the fair maiden.\n\nThe path is well traveled and recently paved heading out to the Nevada Wildlife Refuge.  At the only intersection, the direction (Mormon Well Road to Gass Peak Road) was easily illuminated.\n\nSmaller chariots were observed in the area but be forewarned, this is a rough road.\n\nThis journey is not for the faint of heart and it is highly recommended that if attempted...in the months especially when it his hotter than Hades, one should plan for every contingency because despite the illusion...you are in wild country. WATER!\n\nSome 35 minutes of travel you can expect to find a very recognizable trail head.  At this trail head, arrows were literally shot and heavy packs were laden on the backs of the knights in preparation for future battle.  \n\nThe two would march off looking to climb the spine of the tarragon.  A word to the wise...when you meet the fork: TAKE THE RIGHT even when everything is telling to take the left.\n\nUp and up went the knights (who took a left and then blazed their own route).  Strengthened by previous adventures, they went higher into clouds.  When the beaten track began to fade, a cairn would materialize and show the way.\n\nFearing that my time is running short as are my yelp characters, let me speed up this tale. We made our way up the spine of the beastie and this knight's lower armor (shorts) began to sag.  Fortunately, beneath the armor lay another form of protection.  When I reached the summit this knight became a jester, as I was now wearing my armor around my ankles.  Armed now only with spandex, a timely spear of joy was thrust into the heart of Gass.\n\nThe princess (view) had sadly (but expected) already been claimed.  Many times in fact, but not by many yelpers.  The summit log is located between the benchmarks, and it was full of previous conquistadors.  Sauron is nothing but solar panels fueling the communication needs for various agencies.\n\nBut this was the moment of greatness for Zack M. & Paul W.  We celebrated our victory with song and the sweet taste of unicorn tears.\n\nHeading down what was now a trail of redemption and victory, my thoughts drifted to preparation for future adventures.\n\nAs of 02\/21\/16, when I catch Gass Peak out of the corner of my eye, I can't help but smile and feel an overwhelming sense of satisfaction.  GO SLAY YOUR DRAGON!!","useful":7,"funny":8,"cool":6,"type":"review"}

Aren't you more than first meets the eye.\n\nI seem to be going through a phase of reviewing chains, but if you'll forgive me my sins, sometimes the things you need are hard to find and the chains can provide. Holland & Barret is a chain, and there are several of them in the city. Edinburgh only has one big Boots on the Princes Street, 100 Starbucks, and 3 Holland & Barrets all within 20 - 25 minutes of each other (the other two are on Rose Street and Nicholson Street).\n\nI do stop in here to buy several items regularly, mainly their healthy energy bars and food stuffs. The Nicholson Street branch is my local and so the only one I've been into. I think I gave it a fairly middle-of-road review. It supplies most of the products I need.\n\nOr so I thought until I came to this branch. It wasn't planned. I was going to the optician next door and needed to get some things so thought I may as well whilst close by. The outside looks exactly the same as the outside of the Nicholson Street branch and appears to occupy the same space. But open the doors and suddenly it expands inwards like a tardis. And the first thing I noticed was a fridge unit! What the what?!\n\nI was in a rush and needed particular items so didn't have a chance to explore, but I will go back to do just that. The items I needed (protein supplements \/ bars \/ shakes and the like) were much  more expansive in range than in the Nicholson store too. So much so that I actually took a lot longer than planned and had to run for my bus. There's a fantastic range of different bars, flapjacks, ready-made shakes. I was looking to get the 'cleanest' type of protein supplements I could that weren't choc-full of sweetners, nuts and caramel (why are most of them fake mars bars?!) The ones I found did still have sweetners but there was a much bigger range that allowd me to pick the best looking ones. Again, really great range.\n\nThe shop assistant was also really top chat and banter. He laughed at how many protein shakes a wee waif of a girl was packing into her basket (I'm going away for 2 weeks and needed to stock pile) and we got chatting. Really down to earth, friendly and genuine. I love that sort of thing about customer service, and I'm proud to say it seems to be a Scottish trait.\n\nAnyway, this store is much bigger than some others I've been into. Whilst it's a chain, and can probably charge more than some smaller independents, it usually has great offers on (everything the store was buy one get one half price when I was in) and they are pretty much guaranteed to have the health supplement you need.

Ausnahmsloser Enthusiasmus an allen Fronten. Also waren wir neugierig mit leicht gesteigerter Erwartungshaltung, unter anderem auch, weil im ersten Anlauf andere GÃ¤ste schneller waren und wir mit dem Versuch, Freitagmittag fÃ¼r Freitagabend zu reservieren, leider nicht landen konnten. Also Ã¤chzten wir chronisch Kurzentschlossene und legten uns ungewohnt frÃ¼h fÃ¼r den Freitagabend fest, in mehr als einer Hinsicht, denn uhrzeitmÃ¤Ãig schielte zumindest ein Auge auf das erste WM-Qualifikationsspiel gegen die FÃ¤rÃ¶er.\nÂ \nSo dachten offenbar auch andere, denn der Innenhof, in dem wir bei angesagt gutem Wetter reserviert hatten, war schon gut besucht. Man brachte uns zu einem grÃ¶Ãeren Tisch, der fÃ¼r vier gedeckt war und fragte, ob es uns stÃ¶ren wÃ¼rde, wenn sich noch andere GÃ¤ste dazusetzten. Ehrlich gesagt schon, war unsere Antwort, und sofort wurde klag- und kommentarlos die andere HÃ¤lfte abgerÃ¤umt und uns die StÃ¼hle etwas anders hingerÃ¼ckt. Sehr schÃ¶n.\nÂ \nGleich darauf kam die Karte, nett gebunden, mit einem relativ klassischen griechischen Angebot und einer auffallend groÃen Auswahl an Vorspeisen. Ouzo als Aperitiv war uns ein biÃchen zu heftig, also Aperol Sprizz und weiteres Studium von Karte und Umgebung. Sehr Ã¼bersichtliche Weinauswahl, offen dankenswerterweise in unterschiedlichen LosgrÃ¶Ãen (0,2l, 0,5l und 1l) zu bestellen, weitgehend Ã¤hnliche Weine auch flaschenweise. Preisniveau griechisch-gÃ¼nstig. Der Innenhof nett zum Sitzen, geflochtene Lounge-StÃ¼hle und ordentlich groÃe Tische gemischt mit HolzlattenstÃ¼hlen nebst passenden Tischen. An den Mauern GrÃ¼n, mit einbrechender Dunkelheit machten sich die Energiesparlaternen recht unangenehm bemerkbar. Die Kerzen in den hÃ¼bschen Laternen auf den Tischen blieben wÃ¤hrend unseres Besuchs aus, schade. Vielleicht wurden sie spÃ¤ter noch gezÃ¼ndet?\nÂ \nWir fragten die freundliche Bedienung nach der MÃ¶glichkeit, uns eine gemischte Vorspeisenplatte fÃ¼r zwei zusammenzustellen, sie schlug verschiedene Cremes \/ PÃ¼rees und GemÃ¼se vor, wir stimmten zu. Danach wollte mein Mann - Ãberraschung! - die Lammkoteletts und ich die gegrillten Sardinen. Dazu mangels anderer trockener WeiÃweinalternativen den offenen griechischen Chardonnay (der dann wie befÃ¼rchtet nach nicht viel schmeckte) Â und eine groÃe Flasche Wasser, die mit â¬ 3,50 geradezu sensationell gÃ¼nstig daherkam.\nÂ \nWir hatten vorab noch gewitzelt, ob wir es ausnahmsweise mal schaffen wÃ¼rden, den Aperitiv zu trinken, bevor die Vorspeisen kÃ¤men. Tja, Pech gehabt, das Konzept des Aperitivs wird noch brauchen, um in Deutschland anzukommen, aber nur mal fÃ¼rs Protokoll, wÃ¼rden Sie Aperol Sprizz zum Essen trinken wollen? Ich definitiv nicht.\nÂ \nDie Vorspeisenplatte, die spÃ¤ter mit â¬ 6,50 pro Nase auf der Rechnung erschien, war ebenso klassisch wie die Speisekarte: verschiedene SchafskÃ¤secremes, Taramasalata, AuberginenpÃ¼ree, fritierte Zucchini- und Auberginenscheiben, fritierte lange dÃ¼nne Paprika und viele Tomatenscheiben. Alles frisch, geschmacklich gut, aber das kÃ¶nnten wir im Diogenes genauso haben, da aber eher noch mehr Auswahl. Ich wÃ¼rde hier definitiv empfehlen, aus dem interessanteren Einzelangebot der Vorspeisen nach gusto zu ordern, das wÃ¤re bestimmt spannender gewesen. Dazu gab es gutes Brot, irgendwo zwischen WeiÃbrot und Bauernbrot, frisch und mit BiÃ.\nÂ \nZiemlich genau in der Mitte der Vorspeise kam die Slapstickeinlage - eine Bedienung, die bislang nicht an unserem Tisch aufgetreten war, kam mit einem Teller Sardinen und wollte servieren. Wir erklÃ¤rten, daÃ wir die Sardinen als Hauptgericht bestellt hÃ¤tten und zeigten auf die noch gut gefÃ¼llte Vorspeisenplatte. Woraufhin uns beschieden wurde (O-Ton): \"Ãh, die hat gerade ziemlich viel zu tun\", offenbar in der Absicht, die Sardinen bei uns abzuladen, was aber mit unserem UnverstÃ¤ndnis \"wir sind gerade bei der Vorspeise, was sollen wir denn machen?\" kollidierte. Abzug des SardinentrÃ¤gers, RÃ¤tselraten bei uns am Tisch. Trainee erwischt? Sardinen zuviel? Fragen Ã¼ber Fragen...\nÂ \nNachdem wir die Vorspeisen bewÃ¤ltigt hatten, dauerte das AbrÃ¤umen ein biÃchen, aber als dann der freundliche Herr kam, der uns empfangen hatte, schien die Feedback-Schleife funktioniert zu haben, er fragte nÃ¤mlich, ob man mit den Hauptspeisen weitermachen sollte. Wir baten um eine Pause und bekamen die sehr nette und souverÃ¤ne Antwort, man wÃ¼rde das selbstverstÃ¤ndlich nach unseren WÃ¼nschen einrichten. Aufatmen unsererseits.\nÂ \nNach einer angenehmen Pause kamen erneut Besteck und Servietten auf Beistelltellern (jaaa, das mÃ¶chte ich ausdrÃ¼cklich loben, es gibt viel zuviele Restaurants dieser Art die auf Mehrfachnutzung des Bestecks insistieren, was fÃ¼r mich 1A-SpaÃverderberei ist - soviel Besteckbestand bzw. SpÃ¼lmaschinenleistung muÃ einfach da sein), das abgerÃ¤umte Brot sahen wir nicht wieder. Wir erklÃ¤rten die Pause fÃ¼r ausreichend und baten um die H...","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Die Entscheidung war anfangs etwas schwierig, da die Homepage dieses Restaurants zwar einen Auszug aus der Karte zeigt, allerdings ohne Preise. Als wir dann aber doch vor dem Restaurant standen und einen Blick auf die Speisekarte im Schaukasten geworfen haben, waren wir erst von der kleinen Auswahl enttÃ¤uscht sind jedoch trotzdem reingegangen. Ein Blick auf die Karte im Restaurant hat unsere Laune dann schlagartig geÃ¤ndert. Super Preise und sehr gute Auswahl!! Also kein Grund dies nicht auf der Homepage zu zeigen! \n\nWir hatten nicht reserviert bekamen aber trotzdem nach einer kurzen Wartezeit einen Platz. Die freundliche Servicemitarbeiterin hat uns auch versichert, dass wir auf jeden Fall einen Platz bekommen und wir kÃ¶nnen doch schonmal GetrÃ¤nke bestellen. \n\nZum Essen ist zu aller erst zu sagen, dass das Taramas einfach unglaublich gut geschmeckt hat! Alle Daumen hoch! So ein gutes Taramas haben wir noch nie gegessen. Als Vorspeise hatten wir einen gemischten Salat sowie das Taramas, dazu gab es einen Brotkorb. \nAls Hauptgang hatte wir zwei Gyros (9,90 â¬), einmal Bifteki mit SchafskÃ¤se gefÃ¼llt und eine gemischte Vorspeise (als Hauptgang). Zu den Grillgerichten gab es jeweils selbstgemachte Pommes, sehr lecker. Leider war die gemischte Vorspeise etwas enttÃ¤uschend. Geschmacklich zwar sehr lecker, aber von der Auswahl eher sparsam. Da in der Beschreibung nur stand 'kalte und warme Vorpeisen' hatte ich mich auf eine super leckere Auswahl gefreut (da die einzelnen Vorspeisen wirklich vielversprechend geklungen haben). Allerdings gab es dann 'nur' vier verschiedene Pasten (Taramas, SchafskÃ¤se, Auberginen und Tzatzika). dazu gab es frittierte Zucchini und Auberginen und eine Peperoni. Wie gesagt, sehr lecker, aber trotzdem enttÃ¤uschend. Auch ist hier ein Punkt abzuziehen, da ich nicht noch einmal Brot zu der Vorspeise akka Hauptspeise bekommen habe und eine weitere Brotbestellung 1,50 gekostet hÃ¤tte. Auf meine Nachfrage ob ich denn bitte nur eine Scheibe Brot haben kÃ¶nne, meinte die Servicekraft zwar ja klar, jedoch ist das Brot nie gekommen.\n\nAnsonsten war der Service auch sehr gut und aufmerksam. \n\nLeider gab es keinen Ouzo als BegrÃ¼Ãung\/Abschied so wie man es von vielen Griechen gewohnt ist. Macht nichts, wÃ¤re aber trotzdem schÃ¶n :)","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

But I'm sad to say they have really gone downhill.  They now have so many pre sales,  ( now you can buy your way into a presale, but I'm coming here to save money people! )  that by the time they open to the public there is truly nothing but junk left.  I went right at opening this morning,  (on opening day) and found 1 convertible car seat, and 1 high chair! Seriously?!  I waited for an hour to look at 1 car seat? I think they need to get rid of the new mom presale. I need car seats and strollers just as much as a new mom....Plus it's so easy for people to abuse that presale.  I mean, how do they actually verify that you are a new mom? \n\nPlus I feel the quality control has really gone down hill. A lot of the items seemed very dirty.  I've consigned in the past and they used to be pretty good at filtering out the poor items and out of season clothing.  But today I found tons of worn clothes and lots of stains. It was a lot of searching to find little worth taking home. \n\nIf you can get in on a presale, then definitely go and find some deals.  It's worth it then.  Good selection and shorter lines.  \n\nBut ....if you can't get in on a pre sale,  don't waste your time in my opinion.  And if you happen to work and can't get there until Friday evening or Saturday morning...sorry folks,  you are SOL because you will  be scraping the bottom of the barrel to find even one decent item to take home.

Still, it was perhaps the worst Mexican food I had in the city.  The rice was cooked with canned veggies, the salsa might as well have come out of a can (it probably did), and none of the flavors in a simple veggie burrito meshed well.

I used to live around the corner and go there a lot and for what it is, it's pretty good! \n\nThey offer burritos, quesadillas, and fajitas with options of grilled vegetables, chicken, steak, pork and I think maybe some sort of tofu-type thing. Sometimes I order the \"burrito in a bowl\" which is just a little more of everything without the tortilla. \n\nLike others have said, the guac is extra but it's not bad and their \"burrito sauce\" (chipotle and lime) and pico de gallo is pretty damn tasty! I particularly like their decor, it's pretty cheesy but fun. Colourful with upbeat music and a cool patio that is always empty.

I would suggest avoiding the lettuce (more on this later) and green peppers. The green peppers were distracting and made eating it difficult and messy.\n\nMy main gripe with this place is by default, they both put lettuce in your burrito and put it in a panini press. On their own, either is fine, but together they result in a burrito full of droopy, wilted lettuce. Not appetizing.\n\nAs others have said, the guacamole is not free, but the student discount takes care of most of that, if you're able to take advantage.\n\nI'd probably continue to eat there if I was already in the area, but I would never go out of my way to eat here.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I did research before I chose them over PODS, reasoning that United and Mayflower have been in the moving business a long time.  What I found is that this company over promises and under delivers. We were told we would have 6 men, for as long as we needed, who would load our items and secure them with straps and tie downs for transport. It was at a cost of $2,000.  They sent 3 men.  We had 4 containers but only 3 arrived at our destination.  When that last container was delivered, the local rep could not raise the door, which was bowed outward.  The container had to be taken back to the warehouse so the door could be forced open. We were horrified by what we saw.  The Phoenix team who represents United Mayflower did not tie or strap anything down in this container, as they were supposed to.  When the unsecured cargo was tipped in loading and unloading, everything was flung forward.  Boxes of books, fragile items, and furniture flew everywhere. I was very glad I over did it with bubble wrap, as those items, which were upside down and had heavy boxes of books crushing them, survived. Our furniture was another story: two very nice armchairs are ripped. There is a huge gouge in the front of an antique cherry cabinet.  UM paid for being so late with the belongings, but when it came to the claim for damage, they stuck to the contract of insuring our belonging at a rate of .60 a pound. Choosing their insurance was very costly, and our homeowners insurer told us up front that our policy does not cover items in transit. That was a stupid choice by me, but I figured if I packed everything carefully, and paid UM for their Plus Moving service, all would be well. They stick to their contract for insurance, but ignore the fact that I did not get what I paid for manpower for loading and securing our belongings. By the time all is done, I saved NO money by using the container services in lieu of standard moving truck, and now am stuck with damaged good that will be expensive to repair.

Couldn't find anything that came close to this place! \n\nI'm a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom large with the BIGGEST patio I have ever seen in an apartment, resort style patio doors all around, a nice gas fire place and a security system for 900$ a month. I love the location of it first and foremost, with us being a military family living close to Creech but not in the far NW was a MUST since I have to commute to Nellis. Just north of Summerlin, just south of Centennial and I have very easy access to the 215 and the 95. I will say, sometimes making a left onto Durango can be a bit of a pain, but there is a U turn not too far that I usually do. There is NO section 8 housing, or any government housing in this complex, and they don't make any favors for rent payments.\n\nThe staff here is great, Sherry and Ellen are fantastic. The maintenance workers are great too, always very polite,friendly and quick to fix any discrepancies. Only down fall is, they cannot do ANY work at night, so when it's July and your AC stops working at 8pm be ready to either sweat a lot or stay in a hotel. The pool is rarely ever crowded, and where there are people near the pool, they're very quiet, keeping to themselves. If you have any issues with your neighbors, they're quick to take action and the issues is always resolved. They're VERY strict with their lease enforcement rules, if you're the kind that likes to have a surround sound home theater in your apartment, look else where!  \n\nThis community is one of the few Vegas apartments that do not have a gate standing wide open all hours of the day and night, and there is NO key code, it's all remotes that open the gates, And I love that! Sometimes there will be a car waiting for the gate to open but if you're anything like me, I usually stop and wait for the gate to shut behind me. A LOT of residents do this to keep our community free of issues. Most residents have lived here for a long time, its rare to see people moving out. This complex houses a lot of military members,and short term housing as well with fully furnished units to rent.\n\nSo safety and peacefulness at night, well, it is SO quiet here at night, the only noise you hear is from the traffic on Durango! It's fantastic to live in an apartment and not have to worry about your vehicle, your patio, and almost all of the apartments have their own stairwell, so if someone is coming up your stairwell you're not assuming its the neighbors.  The night patrol is really great, they're always out walking the property, chit chatting with neighbors outside in the evenings and making their presence known. \n\nMy ONLY complaint about the complex is the master bathrooms are tiny, but the closets are giant. AND the master bed room gets REALLY REALLY hot, it's almost unbearable in the summer, there isn't much you can do about that either, it's a design flaw. \n\nI'd totally recommend this complex to anyone who isn't a partier, this place is not for them. Perfect for singles,young families,older families,and seniors.","useful":10,"funny":4,"cool":3,"type":"review"}

I love to find vintage boutiques with great stuff at good prices but even more important than what I find are the people who run the store and how they interact with me during my shopping experience. This boutique gets five stars for all of these merchant qualities. The City of Mesa should be proud to have such a great businesses in their City.  I found the most exquisite Italian stainless steel 3 piece sorbet set with a full 12 piece set in perfect condition. This is a one of a kind find that I could not leave at the store. Did I mention the fabulous price on this rare find. Susanne, Fifi and myself all came up with many ways I can use this set in entertaining at home with friends. Fifi also has beautiful authentic designer handbags at great prices. I plan on making one of these my next purchase. The worst part about finding this store is that I am not in Mesa full time. I have houses both here and in Las Vegas. I guess I know where I will be going each time I am in Mesa.  Maybe being in both locations is a plus so I don't spend so much money. \n\nIt is interesting because I found a Las Vegas designer\/vintage clothing store that I thought was also fabulous however I was treated so rudly the first and second time in the store I decided that no designer deal was worth being treated like I was inferior to the person I was paying. I will stick with Fifi and leave the unnamed store in Vegas to treat other customers rudly. The owner of that boutique banned me from her store because of a unfavorable Yelp review, told me I was evil and God would punish me.

Need I say more?  \nI strongly advise anyone looking for a gym membership in the Cleveland area to stay far, far away from Urban Active.  Bally's and Fitworks might not be as flashy as Urban Active, but at least they won't rob you blind.\nMy 2 year membership was up with Urban Active in March of this year.  I went into the gym in April to sign the paperwork to cancel my membership and was treated horribly.  Even though I had every right to cancel my membership because my agreement was up, the meathead so-called manager that I was dealing with acted as if I was trying to scam them by cancelling..  After 20 minutes of questioning me on why I was cancelling, I was relieved to leave and be done with that place for good.  Little did I know I would have to deal with the idiots that work there several more times.\nIn July I was looking over my bank account statement and realized that Urban Active was still withdrawing membership fees from my account.  I called the Corporate line and they told me they never received any notice of my cancellation from the Crocker Park Urban Active.  I called the the gym and spoke to a manager to explain my situation.  Their response to my issue was that they don't keep a copy of the cancellation documents, they just send them on to Corporate.  And if something happens to the documents in the process, that isn't their fault.  I was livid.  I went back in to Urban Active to fill out cancellation documents AGAIN.  And guess what?  Somehow the paperwork got lost in the mail this time as well.  Imagine that.  So I went in to Urban Active for the THIRD time to sign cancellation documents and this time, they had the NERVE to charge me a $10 cancellation fee!  This time the documents miraculously reached the Corporate Office and my membership was cancelled.  But the best part is, they are charging me for 2 MORE MONTHS because they claim it is their right to do so.  So due to the errors of the idiots working at Urban Active, I will end up paying for over 6 months of a membership that was supposed to be cancelled in April.

Well done. Benny, their manager lays out the elaborate scam. BEWARE, DO NOT BUY OR EVEN CONSIDER SUCH SHADY TRADERS\n\nI saw a car that I thought was good for my use and rang up the dealer, a week prior to seeing the car. I was told over the phone that I would have to pay a deposit $500 and that I'd have to get cash as they did not have a machine to charge credit cards.\n\nI see the car, speak to a salesman and negotiate the price. I have a conversation with the salesman and said that I need have lunch and to get cash and will be back. On my way back, I ring up the salesman and say I am on the way. \n\nAs I return to the dealer, the salesman tells me that Benny is selling the car to a customer over the phone. I wait outside Benny's room (as he was on the phone) and finally speak to Benny. He tells me that there is a customer who is willing to pay full price for the car and that the customer has already given their credit card number as a deposit. That was their poorly thought out story.\n\nThe dealer does not have a credit card machine and hence cannot charge the credit card. Furthermore, this 'mysterious' customer has not seen the vehicle and has agreed to purchase the car, full price, according to Benny (as one would expect him to say). During a test drive, the salesman told me that the car had been sitting on the lot for the whole of summer!\n\nThis dealer is a waste of time and one that goes back on their word. \n\nI made the right decision in walking out, never to return.

I came as a student looking for a nice used car. I was drawn to the BMW by the great shape it was in for a 9 year old car. I met the salesman Simon who showed me the car inside and out and I was sold. I got a great deal and peace of mind getting a warranty package in the purchase price. The day I received the car I noticed during the delivery process a few stone chips occurred. I then called the salesman, Simon, who has very helpful and said for me to bring it in. He then determined it would be best to replace the windshield and had it promptly done in a few hours leaving me satisfied. He had also put 4 brand new name brand tires on my car during the safety certificate, not like most dealers.

Please note however, this is the first time buying a car for me; however, I did not feel too pressured.\n\nIt took a while to find this dealership because of the hidden location. On the outside the building looks a bit shady. The interior is not great either. Ben allowed me to take a test drive, but sat in the back. That was something I didn't quite like, but the positive side was throughout the entire ride he did not say anything to try to push for a sale. A carproof was provided and I looked at the entire car - all the while Ben did not try to hassle or tell me how \"great\" the car was. Even when I asked him to take the car to a mechanic, he simply said he had nothing to hide.\n\nI came back 2 days later and took it to a mechanic to inspect. Again, Ben locked his office door and hopped into the back of the car. I test drove the car again on the highway and then took it to a mechanic for pre-purchase inspection. The entire trip was about 5 hours and besides the end where Ben looked slightly pissed for being out so long and telling us that he has to get back to his office, there was very little talk from him. He let us choose the mechanic within a reasonable distance away from the dealership. I would say this experience was alright.\n\nAfter the pre-purchase inspection it was found that the car needed all 4 brakes replaced, and there was a small water pump leak. The brakes Ben agreed to replace all 4 with aftermarket brakes; however, he was not willing to admit the water pump leak and wanted to start a fight with the mechanic :P. Too bad the mechanic already left for the day.\n\nNow when we arrived back at the dealership we immediately sat down and talked about price. Now this is the part where it was a bit stingy as we went back and forth negotiating for the price. He was very firm about the prices. In the end I struck a deal for about $700 less than what was stated (Non-certified \/ \"As is\").\n\n In general the car is very clean for the price which a couple of mechanics have since told me that its a pretty good deal. \n\nOne thing I didn't like was that the car was not very clean (showroom clean) with crumbs in the ashtray compartment and dusty in the engine compartment. Ray, another sales person helped me clean the car engine a bit despite the fact that it wasn't him taking my sale. They did wash my car before me leaving, but the interior was still pretty dirty.\n\nOverall the experience was OK. Ben seemed a bit lazy, but at the same time I didn't feel too pressured to buy the car. He was very transparent about everything but when it comes to prices and amenities at the end its a bit tough to get what you want. The dealership is also ALRIGHT. It is tucked away, it looks sketchy but their lot is not that bad.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

In the foyer there's a hostess to direct you to either the bar (Bogey's) or seat you in the Onyx restaurant. \n\nI had the Aragosta di Salmone ($27). The description begins, \"Salmon and Lobster pair delectably well\" but the only lobster you get is in the bisque that drowns the entire salmon steak. The bisque was really good, but it was very tomato forward and not very lobster. Plus I really enjoy salmon and i like the fish to speak for itself. I think the dish would have been better off if the bisque were a a mist; not a waterfall. But that's just my personal take on how I like salmon. Doesn't mean the dish was bad. \n\nMy mom had the Pork Loin Chops ($20) and my bf had the Rib Eye ($27). \n\nThey also had Osso Bucco ($37) and Cioppino ($35). \n\nI'd give this place a higher rating if the prices were slightly lower. After a salad,  three entrees, two glasses of wine, and a desert, our bill was $109 before tip. \n\nThis place is kind of old Vegas. We went on a Wednesday night and there was a female lounge singer singing old Billie Holiday jams and such on a small stage in the corner. She had a great voice, but the setting was kind of inappropriate. I think if you're to have live entertainment in a low key restaurant, there should be more upholstery everywhere to dither out the sound. Otherwise, the sound is too direct. \n\nThe singer was a sweet heart, though. She interacted with the audience and half the crowd there seemed like locals. \n\nThey also had a free raffle for a gift certificate for Onyx. It's a nice gesture, but kind of corny for a place that serves salmon for $27. \n\nI thought the color palette of the decor was kind of schitzophrenic, too. \n\nThe ladies bathroom was huge, though. For a space you could fit two stalls and a sink in, it was a private bathroom. One john, one sink, and a chill out seat, all to yourself. \n\nThere's about twelve tables and booths and a bar. It's a pretty small space, but seems large because it's a perfect rectangle, unbroken up. There's also a bar that seats about eight. The place was at about 40% capacity when we went. Pretty good for a wine and dine joint on a Wednesday night. \n\nOur server was immensely patient, professional, and gracious. \n\nMy assessment in a nutshell is that I would go back if I didn't have to pay for it. The food was good, but beyond what I'd like to pay for that ambiance and meal.\n\n#offthestrip #noncasino","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I have also gotten my eyebrows done here a couple of times when I am feeling the need to be extra polished, and as another reviewer stated, they do a great job and for only $10.  \n\nLocated in the shopping center with Trader Joe's, this tiny place has been there for many years and is a great fit for what I want - I want to sit quietly for about an hour while getting my nails done (quite honestly when I do them myself, my toe nails generally look like I cut them with pliers).  I usually get a full pedicure along with a manicure with no color (I do paperwork all day long, and with color, I end up with streaks of red paint all over everything, I also keep my nails very short).  The entire process (my toes are drying while I get my hands done), usually takes about 45 minutes.  There aren't the perks of a higher priced salon, but a mani and pedi is $35 - which is perfect!  All of the technicians are friendly, helpful and efficient.  \n\nAs a warning, with Trader Joe's right next door, parking can be a bit of a pain during busy Saturdays.  The parking spaces for the shopping center are also oddly sized, so I usually swing around back to the spillover parking so I can get in and out of my SUV.  \n\nThey do appointments but also take walk-ins.  They do let you tip with your credit card (I think?), but I usually bring cash for that.  Grab a coffee from Starbucks or frozen yogurt from FroYo and sit back and enjoy a little pampering.

They did not have my size but Wilson offered me the pair of trousers he was wearing.  He quickly changed out of them and I tried them on and voila I bought very cool mens trousers.  Now I am sure some people will find that strange, but he actually assured me he had only worn them twice and I believed him.

The side I usually walk in is the bakery area with those delicious cakes covered in an orgy of candied fruit and vibrant frosting. They have a great array of pan dulce and Mexican cookies. There are times when I take something like 10 bucks with me and hit up the produce for some yumlicious fruit or the fun little refrigerator section around the \"Aguas Frescas\" area and buy some arroz con leche or Mexican soda. Note: If you have not had a Mexican coke, you have to stop what you're doing this instant and get yourself one right now!!! Mexican soda makes my eyes water every time, both from tears of joy and the hard core carbonation. Get a Mexican coke with some carnitas and you are set! Hands down some of the best prices around! Also if you do plan on going and perhaps wanting to shop but just for a few items take your own bag or hand basket. I only need to shop for myself and now take my own little bag every time. I went recently to this particular Ranch Mart and was scouring the front end of the store for a hand basket and found nothing. After asking several and I mean several employees, someone came up to me and told me they had only one hand basket for the entire store. Turns out folks take their groceries home along with the basket. If you don't have much patience veering the aisles with grocery carts filled with babies and food, you're going to have a heck of a time. Check this place out for yourself. I mean, where else can you go and buy a personal serving of flan, a pan dulce, some chicken feet and botas all under one roof?","useful":2,"funny":2,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

It aims primarily at Hispanic clientele.  The produce includes \"ordinary\" stuff, plus some unusual fruits and vegetables you generally won't find in the better-known grocery stores (Fry's, Basha's, etc).  If there's a chili pepper you want, they probably have it.  But in addition to the grocery is a juice bar with fresh-squeezed juices (like papaya, guayabana, etc).\n\nAnd then there's the lunch counter.  Very Hispanic, and very good.  I don't want to say \"Mexican\" as I suspect it goes beyond just that.  It's simple fare, but very good.  It rivals most full-service restaurants (and beats most of those!).\n\nGreat lunch counter, good grocery, a juice bar, and a Hispanic bakery.

I had to make some repairs to my suspension and afterwards I purchased two brand-new tires and an alignment from Mil Amore. Nothing has changed on the vehicle weight wise and now the vehicle shimmies really bad after 60 mph. So I had my mechanic, that I have trusted for the last 13+ years, to look at it it's and he says that the tires are wearing unevenly and that they are 8 ply and should be 10 ply. He checked the whole suspension to include the shocks to make sure that was the issue and sent me on my way. The other day I had to purchase truck tires for another one of my vehicles through discount so I had them check the tires as well and they said the same thing.....\n\nI finally got some free time in my work schedule so I brought this particular vehicle over to mil amore & explained the problem to the owner. Basically, he came up with every excuse in the book why he would not take care of it. Even after I said I'm willing to prove that the shocks aren't an issue and rotating the tires to the back won't help the issue he still told me that even if I prove that the tires are the issue he still won't take them back because some BS about the manufacturers won't do anything for him. \n\nSo basically, the manufacturer's warranty is BS, his warranty as a business in the state of Arizona is BS & he will sell the wrong tires to anyone just to make a profit and he doesn't care about his quality, integrity or honor. I just lost over $500 to this business, hopefully people will read this review and not waste their hard-earned money as well.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

PflanztrÃ¶ge und eine gute Anordnung der Tische lÃ¤sst das Restaurant nicht so groÃ erscheinen, wie es tatsÃ¤chlich ist. Dadurch entsteht eine gemÃ¼tliche AthmosphÃ¤re.\nSauberkeit\nAlle Bereiche, die wir gesehen haben, waren sehr sauber.

Die LokalitÃ¤t befindet sich bei den SportstÃ¤tten am Rande von Schmiden Richtung Stuttgart-Neugereut. ParkplÃ¤tze sind in ausreichender Zahl vorhanden. Eigentlich hatten wir Lust auf eine tolle Pizza aber es sollte anders kommen. Nach dem Eintritt in die sauberen und gepflegten GastrÃ¤ume wurden wir sogleich vom Servicepersonal empfangen und an einen freien Tisch geleitet. Nach kurzem Studium der sehr ordentlich aussehenden Speisekarte erkundigte sich der flinke und sehr freundliche Ober nach unseren WÃ¼nschen. Dabei gab er uns eine \"Tagesempfehlung\" bekannt, die nicht auf der Speisekarte aufgefÃ¼hrt war: Gemischter Fischteller mit GemÃ¼se und Kartoffeln zu je 19,50 â¬. Unseren ursprÃ¼nglichen Pizzawunsch vertagten wir auf einen spÃ¤teren Besuch und bestellten die Fischteller. Dazu zwei GlÃ¤ser Rotwein \"Primitivo\" der vom Ã¶sterreichischen Zinfandel abstammt und hauptsÃ¤chlich im italienischen Apulien angebaut wird, erfreulicher Weise serviert in 0,25 L GlÃ¤sern und 1 cm Ã¼ber dem Eichstrich eingeschenkt fÃ¼r je 5,50 â¬. Eine Flasche Mineralwasser 3,50 â¬ und zum Ende zwei Espresso je 1,70 â¬.\nDas Restaurant war mittlerweile zu 60 % gefÃ¼llt. Nach einer angenehmen Wartezeit von ca. 20 Minuten wurde das Essen serviert. Der Fischteller war sehr schÃ¶n und appetitlich angerichtet (siehe Foto oben). Er bestand aus je einem kross gebratenen StÃ¼ck Schwertfisch, Zander und Wolfsbarsch die geschmacklich sehr gut gewÃ¼rzt waren. Der gemahlene schwarze Pfeffer auf dem Fisch gab diesem noch eine besondere Note. In der Mitte trohnte noch eine Garnele, die ebenfalls sehr gut geschmeckt hat. Kartoffeln und GemÃ¼se harmonierten gut mit dem Fisch. Der Wein war erwartungsgemÃ¤Ã gut, ebenso Mineralwasser und Espresso.Â \nFazit: Ein rundum gelungener Mittag in einem empfehlenswerten italienischen Restaurant fÃ¼r moderate 57 â¬uro. Wir gehen da jedenfalls noch Ã¶fters mal hin.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The owner (I believe), Dr. Cindie Law is one of the sweetest people out there.  They were always very nice and knowledgeable and caring, and their prices were decent, especially considering the groomers are all students, so I expect them to be less than a professional grooming facility.  My dogs never looked the way I expected them to though, although they were always clean and happy (and that's the important part, really.)  They used to be $25 for a full groom, so after a $10 tip for each dog, $70 a month for my dogs' grooms seemed reasonable.\n\nBut then they got this new woman, I don't know if she's a student of employee, but she was RUDE and incredibly condescending toward my dogs...and toward me.  If you go there and you see a blonde with star tattoos, don't walk, RUN!  That woman is the last person who has the personality or temperment to work with animals.  I ended up complaining about her after two seperate incidences with her.\n\nThe last straw was when I referred yet another friend to them and called for pricing because her dog is much bigger than mine.  I was told the same price that I'd been paying for my two.  Well, after they were done and it came time to pay, I found out my friend's dog just got a bath, and my two (who got a full groom) cost $15 more each.  It would have been nice if they'd told me before, especially considering I'd been going there for every month for years and referred several of their clients to them.\n\nI now take my guys to Just Like Home Doggie Hotel and Grooming...and they are BEYOND fabulous!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

I took my maltese\/ shiba inu 7 month old puppy in for a cut and wash. When i got there the lady hands me my dog and i had to remind her she was missing her collar.

I asked the lady why there were patches and she replies, \" it because she has thick hair and thin hair in places.\" Im not a brain surgeon but looking at her hair i can clearly see its cut short because they cut it short and its long in some areas because its not cut at all. They were also suppose to trim the face but you can see long hairs everywhere.. just uneven by alot all over.\n I then ask the lady if she can go over it again and if it would have been easier to use clippers cause they said they use scissors. She replies that clippers would make it look uneven.... so why do they sell clippers on the shelves i wonder to myself..... S\n So she takes the dog back and after a few minutes i pop my head around the corner to see whats going on and there is the lady using clippers after she just told me it would make it uneven...... hmmm... She then see me and feels obligated to explain why she is using them now. I then hear her tell the other girl she has no idea why she didnt think of this in the first place.. hmmm....... So she gets done, hands me my dog who hair is still uneven.....(her headhair and her body hair being different lengths even though they are not suppose to be) So i can see they have no clue on what they are doing so i pay and walk out. I then realized to myself that they just cut her hair again so there are now hair pieces all over my shirt and all over my car from the ride home..

There's a line-up out the door on the 24th but it moves fast and there are no complaints -- because that's the price of customized service and pre-orders that come out just as you expect.\nNot only are the cuts customized, but I believe the butcher orders as much as possible from local and sustainable livestock producers. Wish he would be more explicit about that, and promote that aspect of the business.\nIn my e-book on food and city building, I argue that independent main street retailers like this are essential to a local and sustainable food system because they can customize their orders, rather than insisting on -- as the supermarkets do -- making one order for one specific formula item for an entire chain -- which virtually makes local and sustainable food impossible.\nThe same attention to customization and smaller orders applies to the condiments that are sold here. All the ones we tried, including one of the sauces we used for baked beans on Xmas Eve, turned out perfectly.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

It smelled musty or just like the place had not been aired out completely. I was greeted by the girl behind the counter, however, when I walked up to the counter I noticed that most of the veggies and toppings looked like they had been sitting out all day. The lettuce had a slight brown color and the tomatoes were completely limp. The green peppers looked like they may have been sitting out for at least two days. \n\nThis mistake is on me because I could have easily walked right out when I saw the toppings but I figured I was already in there so I may as well see it all the way through. I only ordered a regular size turkey & provolone sub which came to $5.57 (with tax). Unsurprisingly, the sub tasted stale and was a complete waste of my money. \n\nIf you do find yourself in the area, continue driving down N.Tryon for another minute.

It's everything you want out of a burger fest with half the work.\n\nThe flip-side, of course, is that if you want to be filled you'll want two.

We drove 30 minutes to be told first it was cash only, but they could bill my insurance for lab work...(?) But like I said, we literally were 8 minutes late when they had nobody else in the lobby and had all these openings, she then tells us we can't be seen that day and we have to reschedule. So we did took a chance and rescheduled for for the next day, and the same brunette girl wrote on the card that our appointment was at 9:30 a.m. I called the morning of our appointment which was the next day to ask if they take credit and debit and double checked the time of the appointment and she told me it was 9:15 a.m. So she purposely put on our card that it was 9:30 when it was 9:15 and if I had not called we would have not been able to have been seen and had the same problem we had the first day. Strictly for comparison purposes- I've worked in detoxes in Arizona and they aren't the best but they help people who want it, and when I worked in Malibu at the number 1 detox and rehab in the nation, we never turned anyone down who needed or wanted help and never would have treated them like this.

So beware of the lady who works in the front and is in charge of the appointments because she is one of the rudest, most unprofessional people I have seen in this field and if you want help and are trying to get it then I suggest that you literally double check your appointment as well as call several times otherwise they will do the same exact thing they did to us. She also explicitly stated that certain patients, based on why they are there, are treated differently and are on more of a strict time schedule. It's definitely not the front desk lady's job to judge why I'm at ANY doctor, as she makes minimum wage and has no medical training. I was here on behalf of my girlfriend and I really hope people read this and see it- because if they are wanting help and trying to get help then I feel they should be treated very nice and with the upmost respect, not to mention the level of professionalism they should have at this office. \nHowever, the nurse and Doctor, when we finally saw them, were spectacular and very professional and helpful.

It's just not as good as the Morrison Street one. \n\nThe first visit afforded us a genuinely bizarre maitre d, who watched over us from afar with an evil glint in his eye and constantly pestered in a bid to get us out for 8pm on the dot. The food was Chop Chop good - yummy - but the creepy service was a bit too weird for me to handle while chowing down on dumplings. \n\nOn second visit it was like entering a ghost restaurant. The space is really big and there were no covers to fill up the tables and give the place a bit of ambiance. It was also quite cold, brrr. And there was odd Chinese opera music playing really loudly over the speakers, meaning it was quite tough to have a conversation. We had to ask the staff to turn it down! \n\nFood on second visit was nowhere near as tasty as other Chop Chop experiences. I think it might have been because we were there on a Groupon deal and the restaurant had changed the unlimited banquet to reflect our thriftiness. There was no lamb with cumin (GUTTED) and the crispy beef was replaced by some kind of chicken dish. Needless to say I was a bit disappointed. But at least the service was tip top this time round! \n\nSo, in summary. Go for the good grub if you don't mind sitting in an atmospheric vacuum. And don't get a Groupon deal - just go for the regular menu and join the loyalty scheme, because the restaurant will shower you in discount vouchers!","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

The excellent staff will give you all the time you need and as long as you are aware that the food comes out when ready (not lined in the way you ordered) you are in for a massive treat. Be aware though that when busy they tend to get things wrong, but that is always easily rectified.

Since the space isn't very large, I'd recommend making a reservation. The restaurant is located in a converted home and I loved its warm yet cozy atmosphere.\n\nWhat we ordered:\n\nFritto Misto del Giorno  - House made mostarda & pickled cherry peppers sott'olio ($16). To be honest, simply reading the menu, I had no idea what this dish was. After quickly searching it up on Google, we discovered its translation was \"fried mixed day.\" Fried? Sold. This turned out to be a great starter - great for sharing! \n\nGrilled Ionian Octopus - Braised chickpeas, crispy onions & pancetta brodo. I thought the octopus itself was just okay (but I have to admit, I'm not a huge fan of octopus in general). I also found the chickpeas to be a tad undercooked as they were still quite hard.\n\nNduja Sausage & Little Neck Clams - Ouzo & shallot brodo with crispy polenta ($16). The portion of this wasn't very large as it came with only five or six clams. However, they were well cooked and the sauce, which contained bits of minced sausage, had a bit of a kick to it and tasted quite nice. My favourite part of this dish was the crispy polenta, which actually came in the form of a polenta stick. I don't normally love polenta, but if it was always served this way, I'd enjoy it a lot more. \n\nSquid Ink Tortelloni with Lobster - Mascarpone, heirloom carrot & brown butter sauce ($28). The highlight of my evening. The portion wasn't very large, but the filling sure made up up for it.. The filling contained large chunks of lobster and the mascarpone filling with the brown butter sauce was incredible. \n\nPerth Farms Berkshire Pork - Grilled shoulder chop & confit belly with caramelized cauliflower ($29). Amazing. Perfectly cooked pork and a large piece of rich pork belly. Simply delicious. My only complaint was that the caramelized cauliflower was really oversalted.\n\nA great Italian restaurant in the Yorkville area - highly recommended!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The dining room, tucked in century-old home, was small but elegantly homey. Our reservation was for 8:30 pm, and by this time, there was only one other occupied table in the restaurant that was already on the dessert course. We were both quite surprised about the emptiness given that it was a Friday night.\n\nSoon after placing our orders, we were served two types of bread with olive oil- focaccia with fennel seeds and some sort of sourdough, I can't remember exactly. The focaccia was particularly excellent. It had an incredibly spongy texture, almost reminiscent of a sponge cake. It was so dense and satisfying, and the fennel seeds added such a lovely dimension.\n\nWinter caesar salad ($14)- garlic sautÃ©ed kale, white anchovy, bacon, focaccia and cauliflower purÃ©e. I missed the usual crunch and lightness of the romaine lettuce. In comparison, the kale felt quite damp and heavy. The components that I did enjoy were the focaccia and cauliflower purÃ©e. But other than that, I didn't care for the salad.\n\nFior di latte mozzarella arancini ($15)- caramelized onions, aged balsamic and mustard seeds. They were delightfully crispy on the outside and hot and gooey on the inside. I also loved the pairing with the tangy balsamic and mustard seeds, and I wanted more of that.    \n\nFritto misto del giorno ($16)- the daily selection of fresh fried seafood and vegetables included calamari, oyster, and zucchini, with black olive tapenade and fresh lemon. I wasn't a great fan of the olive dip, but everything was so fresh and tasty that a squeeze of lemon was sufficient. My favourite component was (surprisingly) the fried zucchini!\n\nRoasted 'sous vide' chicken ($25)-house made mostarda, potato purÃ©e and farm fresh egg yolk. The chicken was incredibly tender and juicy. There's nothing I hate more than dry and overcooked chicken, and in this case, the meat was cooked to perfection and the doneness was uniform throughout. On top of that, the potato purÃ©e was absolutely scrumptious. I have nothing but praise for this dish!\n\nApple pie cannoli ($10)-cinnamon mascarpone, candied pecans, apple caramel. I've never really liked cannoli all that much, but this version definitely won over me. The cinnamon mascarpone filling and the apple caramel really brought out flavours reminiscent of the apple pie, but the usual rich buttery crust is replaced by the fried pastry roll. I really enjoyed this refreshing take on a traditional dessert.\n\nDark chocolate smores torte ($10)- white chocolate crackers, honey marshmallow, and dark chocolate sauce. It was also visually stunning, and I couldn't wait to dig into it. I personally preferred my apple pie cannoli, though the smores torte was undeniably delicious as well. On the whole, I thought both desserts were fantastic!\n\nWith the exception of the salad, the meal was truly wonderful! My favourites were the \"sous vide\" chicken and the apple pie cannoli. But I still couldn't understand why the restaurant was so empty on a Friday night. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed the meal, and I look forward to checking out their sister restaurant l'unitÃ .","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Viele der erklÃ¤rten Dinge weiÃ man als hÃ¤ufige Leserin von TierbÃ¼chern, aber fÃ¼r Jugendliche und Kinder ist die Ausstellung, gerade auch zu heimischen LebensrÃ¤umen sehr anschaulich und pÃ¤dagogisch sinnvoll aufgearbeitet. Anhand ausgestopfter Tiere werden die Tiere, die uns umgeben, vorgestellt. Die KinderfÃ¼hrungen sind toll! Engagierte MuseumspÃ¤dagoginnen erklÃ¤ren begeisterten Kindern anschaulich den Unterschied zwischen HÃ¶rnern und Geweihen oder wie ein Wal sein Baby bekommt. Auch der Spieltrieb der Erwachsenen wird etwa beim Tierstimmenraten bedient. Im Arktisraum kann man eine Polarnacht miterleben und eine Brutkolonie belauschen.\n\n\n Wichtige Themen im Museum sind die Entwicklung des Menschen, wobei man etwa sieht, dass das Gehirnvolumen des Neandertalers unserem entsprach, Mimikry, Lebende Fossilien, Lebensraumanpassung bei Pflanzen und Tieren und NaturgefÃ¤hrdung.\n\n\n Sicher ist das Rosensteinmuseums nicht das grÃ¶Ãte seiner Art in Deutschland, aber immer wieder einen Besuch wert!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

This place opened up a few months ago on Freeport Rd., next to the harmarville \"fun\" center (bowling alley, laser tag, etc.).  Im glad it's here instead of the eye sore that was the closed down Eat n Park'.  I've been here twice most recently this past Friday for lunch.  I've only been here when it's empty, so it seems either I eat lunch too late, they do most biz' at night or I will be referring to this as the place that used to be 3 amigos. I believe it has one sister restaurant.  The space itself is set up very much like the Eat n Park used to be except for the addition of a bar close to the front entrance on the right as you walk in.  The bar is pretty big with about a dozen chairs and a few hi-tops.  There are also a couple plasmas, but overall this is not a place I would go to for cocktails or to hang out.  The service of the bartender has been very friendly and prompt both times.  The chips and salsa are free when you order the food and the chips have always still been hot right out of the fryer.  They could use a few more salsa options as I found the flavor of what I tried to be dull.  They have really good lunch specials with a \"pick one, pick two, and a pick three\" for 5.95 to 7.95.  The \"picks\" are the usual assortment of mexican fare (tacos, burritos, chalupas, etc.).  I've only tried the burritos and tacos and found them to be above average, especially for the price.  The tacos and burritos are piled high with cheese and meat (chicken, steak, ground meat, etc) and come with a large portion of fried beans (bland) and rice (dry).  Overall this is a good place to grab a good inexpensive lunch with a beer or two.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

It was publicized on tv, but only about 50 or so people showed. It was in Glenville about a block south of st.Clair and east of e.105th. Local media personality Mike Olzewski officiated the ceremony. Siegel' s widow and daughter were on the front porch along with other \"dignitaries\".\n\nThe home used to be painted Supe colors, but has now been returned to a more traditional color scheme.

It is a private residence, so there's not much to do but come take a picture of it. The owners are really into the whole thing.

They have put a damper on my engagement and if I could possibly return the ring, I definitely would.\n\nRight after our engagement, my fiance and I went to this location to get my ring resized and get the ring engaged.  My fiance had purchased the ring at Gordon's in Delaware which is a partner company with Zales.  He paid the extra money and chose the credit card in order to get the best possible warranty for the ring.  The ring sizing was included in this; he paid for the engraving.  After about a week, he was called to get the ring.  He saw the engraving but I was not with him so we could not measure the size (although we learned later they could have used a ring sizer (the stick with the sizes in which you can slide the ring down and see the circumference).  He brought it home and I was ecstatic to have it back only to be let down again because it wasn't sized.  \n\nWe went back to the store together the following day.  The associate slid the ring down the sizer and low and behold, the size has not been changed.  The company must keep it another week.  I go again to pick it up and it fits!  The engraving now is, of course, all stretched out but still legible.  I hope to never have to deal with them again until my six month check-up as per the agreement of the warranty.\n\nFour months go by and the band of my ring has a sizable crack in it.  That's right: after all that, the ring they resized (or, rather, sent out to be resized) has broken where it has been welded together.\n\nMy fiance calls the store and tells them what happened.  The associate who picks up answers, \"There's nothing we can do.\" and HANGS UP ON HIM before he can say he has a warranty.  He calls again and explains that he has the warranty.  The associate tells him to come in; my fiance asks if he needs paperwork to which the associate says he does not so off we go.\n\nThe minute we step into the store and find someone to help us, she asks if we have the paperwork.  We explain what happened earlier and she tells us she cannot help us without the paperwork.  SERIOUSLY?!  So now we are fuming.  Then she tells us that the warranty doesn't cover a break in the band anyway.  We have to call Gordon's to get them to talk to this associate to get everything cleared up.  After being there for about an hour and finally getting my ring into the envelope to get sent away, she reminds us that the engraving will have to be done again- at a cost to us.  When both my fiance and I have steam coming out of our ears, she decides there will be no cost-- to be nice.\n\nDO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THESE PEOPLE.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

During that time I purchased a new Mercedes and from time to time have been told by the company that does the occasional detailing,  that the car wash must be using dirty water as there are light brush marks on the paint.  They never seemed like a big issue and I am not so fastidious about my car to switch to another car wash. However,  today they have really caused some damage.  In an attempt to remove something during the pre-machine wash stage,   one of their handwashers must have had a stone in his brush and scratches to the paint are so deep in two places (and 5\" wide) that it will require professional attention and expense.  Accidents happen and I can accept that. However,  within 5 minutes of leaving the carwash I saw the damage and immediately (car still dripping water) I returned to the car wash to show the fellow (the guy who has worked there for 38 years) what had happened.  Given I am a regular,  I would actually have expected a bit of concern.  Before I could barely get the words out of my mouth what had happened,  he threw his hands in the air to say \"didn't happen here\".  Well, given that I don't go to any other car wash and they are clearly marks made in the very circular motion I'd just witnessed the handwashing guy doing,   there is no question they did the damage.   So my advice,  unless you drive a beater and really don't care about your car,  avoid this company.    I can accept that accidents do happen and that the brush might have picked up a stone.  But be professional and own up to the error and offer to fix it - don't treat a 20 year customer with such disrespect.

I have always wanted to try it for years now and finally I said to myself its now or never. I chose Dulak Pilates because of its well known reputation in town as having the best instructors and a wonderful studio. \nKelly is a stellar instructor. There isnt enough adjectives to describe how marvelous she is. She pushes me out of my comfort zone and believe I can do more than I thought I could. My body and mind is changing for the better. After just a few sessions with Kelly, I began to trust in her guidance completely. I feel exhilarated by the challenges in every session. Kelly is a body reader. She has the ability to sense if my muscles is working or not. If it doesn't (sometimes due to me not working hard enough) she would find ways to modify the exercise so I can feel the muscles Im supposed to be working on. She would often modify the exercise to fit my petite frame or my strained neck muscles. I learn to not short change myself and just tell her if I don't feel the mind-body connection working. I also learn that I better do it right and not cheat so she doesnt make me redo them (ahem the hug, the one hundred, the teasers, the elephant, the obliques twist and reach). Im pretty sure they will never get easier. Pilates always have a way to make one feel very humble. After a session a week with Kelly, I feel everything! every small intrinsic muscles has been fine tuned (my triceps, biceps, the abs to the obliques to the inner thighs and the glutes to even the back of the legs). \nI drive an hour once a week to Dulak Pilates Center to take my lesson. I might hate the drive but I have never ever regret a pilates session with Kelly.  I walk out of the studio glad that I came, glad I gave it my all and glad that Kelly is my instructor who help me to strengthen not only my powerhouse but also my mental toughness. When I thought I couldn't hold my power house or squeeze my inner thighs any longer, Kelly would tell me to do it one more time. \nThank you Kelly for teaching me that my body and mind are limitless and that I am capable of exceeding my own limit. Thank you for educating me about the biomechanics of human movement, and the importance of taking care of the body especially the core, the spine and all the joints. \nThank you Kelly for your patience with me and for your passion for teaching. I recommend taking classes from Dulak Pilates Center because of their high quality instructors. I can attest that not only Kelly has a comprehensive educational training but she has also put in countless hours and energy to become a competent qualified teacher. Pilates is all about the integration and coordination of mind, body and spirit. Try it for yourself! You will fall in love with it like I did! The studio is running an offer for Saturday morning reformer classes for only $30 per class!!!. My only regret is that I wish I had taken Pilates sooner when I used to live in town! I would so go every day.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

It's located in a business park on Gibson Road and totally unassuming. Actually, if you didn't map it or look for the building number, you would never know it was there! It's unmarked and behind Green Valley Pools - look for the wooden barrel outside the door! You can park on Mary Crest or in the lot by their building.\n\nI called about two months ago to inquire about their monthly tours and I was able to reserve a spot for me and my fiancÃ© that way. When you get to the brewery, they collect $5 from each person, you sign in, and you get a very cool souvenir JJBC glass!\n\nWe got a quick history lesson and were given the opportunity to ask questions while browsing the space. Then, we jumped right into the best part, beer tasting. \n\nWe were offered their nine current beers. Fox Tail Gluten-Free Pale Ale (similar to a cider, light, but not sweet with a hint of hops; decent for a GF beer!), American Lager, Weize Guy Hefenweizen, Citra Rye Pale Ale, Hop Box Imperial IPA, J.J. Pro AM Foreign Extra Stout (Limited), Red Fox Russian Imperial Stout Dark Ale, Baby J's German Chocolate Cake Milk Stout (Limited), and 5th Anniversary Barrel Aged Smoked Wee Heavy Scotch Ale (Limited). Alcohol content ranged from 5-14%.\n\nEveryone was really awesome and they were very generous with the tasting portions, inviting us to whatever was left over if we pleased. It was obvious that they were all very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about their jobs and the brewery. It created a wonderful atmosphere for a beer tour\/tasting. \n\nI'm not much of a beer drinker, so I can't really say how good it was or if it was better or worse than other beers in the same categories. My gauge is what my beer enthusiastic fiancÃ© says. He really enjoyed all of them and states that the respective beers stood up to his favorite beers. His favorites from today were Hop Box and Red Fox. We both enjoyed Baby J's and will be searching for bottles soon since it's on a limited run.\n\nThe best part was not having to leave the valley for great craft beers and a brewery experience. I highly recommend the tour to all beer enthusiasts!","useful":9,"funny":1,"cool":6,"type":"review"}

The Croque was served with string french fries that had just enough golden crunch and just enough softness to rival McD's...\n\nI had the salad(can't remember what it was called), with seasoned, toasted walnuts and rich crumbled bleu cheese...John told us the walnuts were rolled in cayenne pepper and rosemary, and let me tell you--I'm a sucker for flavored walnuts in salad, be they with spices or with sugar, so I LOVED it...the salad came drizzled in a champagne vinagrette that paired nicely with Jamie's wine: the to-die-for Rosa Regale Banfi Sparkling Red...that wine was SO good that I've bought it from Whole Foods 3 times since visiting Jug...it's rich and thick(not syrupy, just not barely-existent, like most sparkling wines)...and it tastes like rose petals and strawberries :)\n\nalso, during the meal, John brought out a special he had created--2 juicy steak medallions drizzled in honey balsalmic--Jamie's reaction was \"That could be the only sauce I'd eat with steak, besides A1\"...it was lovely...\n\nanyway, definitely going back there, monthly, for their wine-tasting Thursday nights, as recommended by the chef :)","useful":2,"funny":2,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

Upon arrival, my friend and I decided that even if we couldn't buy a bottle to depart with, the atmosphere was pleasant enough to stick around for. You know, for a glass of wine.\n\nWe sit at the nice dark wood bar and the bartender sweeps over. My friend was undecided on her choice and, on my suggestion, asked the bartender.\n\nThis was the best choice made that day. By anyone. Anywhere.\n\nThe somo....somma.....sumal.....wine guy asked her about her tastes and preferences (red, non-specific) and gave her a few tastes. A bit more conversation and he recommends going for the \"Discovery\" flight. This turns out to be a fantastic idea for her. A spectrum of red wine was put before her and she was left in a state of bliss.\n\nThe....wine guy turns to me and asks about my tastes (red zinfandels, the \"real\" ones, as I found out), but I'm open to trying new wines. He thinks on it for a second and mutters a few possibilities while he looks at the shelf of wine behind the bar. Inspiration strikes, and he pulls out a pinot noir. Strange, but I'll go along with it. It was the damnedest thing, but if it wasn't a pinot noir that has a lot of the earthy characters that I love in red zin.\n\nSo that was how the night went. By the time I left there, with the good-matured feeling that wine gives you, I had been thoughroughly educated in all sorts of things about wine.  I actually even found out that the winery that sells one of my favorite zins has \"sold out\". Sad, but always good to know.\n\nIn short: Go here now! Sit at the bar with your friend(s) and talk to the (asks Mr.Internet) sommelier! and enjoy some fantastic service and, of course, wine.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I went to the Apple Store, and they noticed just from looking the exterior that something was not right.

There are other tile stores in town that carry much of the same merchandise, and their staff was much more helpful at helping me find items in their stores that they thought would meet what I was looking for.  I had to aggressively engage the sales girl here twice during my visit just to get some attention.  If I had a couple weeks to wait for the other stores to order my tile, I would have saved about half and been treated better.  Mexican Tile & Stone had what I wanted in stock, so I paid full retail prices to get it.  Paying such a premium I mistakenly thought I'd get a premium product, but much of it had serious paint and\/or glazing defects requiring me to rifle through the supply in their warehouse to get tiles that didn't look significantly different from each other.  Before this last step, the sales girl had made sure to have me sign TWO waivers about these being hand-made tiles and that I should expect variations.  Variation is one thing, and in the QC world variation has an acceptable tolerance range. Many of the tiles they tried to send home with me were downright defective and unquestionably outside any range of acceptable variation.  There weren't enough of the \"good\" tiles for my project, so I took a few of the best of the bad and had my tile installer mix them in the project so they weren't so visible.  However, I notice them every time I look at it and it really bugs me I spent full retail for these tiles.  Definitely a lesson learned by me - build enough time in a project to pick out materials from a different tile store and have them ordered.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The clasp on the necklace was hard to separate and it broke before I had a chance to wear it. The next day we took it back to the shop and the young lady was very helpful. They didn't have another one so she told me that the manager would order one for me. They were great in the follow up and the next day they received another one and called me to tell me they would send it to me. Lono God of Peace is a fun shop, they have great jewelry with great prices.

They had some pretty items in the window that caught my eye (bless you ADD); namely those jewelry stands that are different female forms with different kinds of dresses. They also had pretty jewelry cases and fun feminine novelty items like pen holders that are deep high heel shoes. Hard to describe...and visiting their website won't give you much more idea, although their site says you can request a full catalog.\n\nI suggested they start using Twitter and Facebook to gain more of a following. Their location is in the long hallway between the main casino of Paris and Bally's, I don't remember exactly what stores neighbor it, but it's a nice gem worth checking out, mainly for women. It's behind one of the long ramps, so make sure you don't miss it (it'll be on your left if you're walking toward Bally's from Paris main casino)\n\nThe two employees were sweet Japanese people, the woman seemed to be the owner and the man was younger. They were super nice and had the donation box for relief in Japan. A short pleasant conversation while they carefully wrapped my two items was quite enjoyable (personal touch) and the woman said bye in Japanese as  I left :)","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Hopefully the letter I just sent to Blockbuster will initiate quick action to avoid having Shaun offend too many other customers. And, thankfully, I don't let such encounters get to me...for long. \n\nAnother reason to avoid the store (assuming it stays open much longer) is that the DVDs in the Kids and Family section are almost all scratched and virtually impossible to watch without issues. Blockbuster needs a policy that encourages people to treat the DVDs with enough care that other people can enjoy the movie for months to come.\n\nI will follow up with the results of my letter to Blockbuster, where I asked that this person either be terminated or given a written warning that such antics will not be tolerated. Period. We'll see, but at least I know that Shaun takes his negative, sarcastic, condescending attitude with him and I never have to experience that level of negativity again.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Here is what it does.  If you, the customer is late, on  an ever discriminatory water bill, even when your use is the same each month.  The Company will disconnect your water services.  We are talking, usually 10 days late.  Fair enough, strict policy, not common to Phoenix, Tempe, Chandler or Gilbert, but ok.\n\n However, it does not matter if it  disconnects your service in the morning, or in the afternoon.  If you immediately pay the balance (owed, which for a residential customer should be between $105.00 to $115.00 bill) and a $70.00 reconnect fee.  You have to weight for the water company to sometime, and often even past the permitted 24 hour time frame.  However, GW will advise you, if you pay an additional $35.00, they can turn the service on that same day, regardless of the time.\n\n The ACC requires GW to turn the water on at a reasonable time once disconnected.  We know that at all times is reasonable because GW can turn it on instantly if you pay $35.00 fee on top of the $70.00 fee.  Next, at one time, maybe just maybe GW had an excuse, but since their disconnect and activation is done remotely, meaning they can turn it on at a flip of the switch, just as they turn it off at the flip of a switch, not only is the $35.00 'blackmail' fee in appropriate.  The $70.00 reconnect fee is inappropriate.  Why, back in the day, yes a company may need a person to go out, turn the water value off, put a tag\/seal on it, and then undue all of it once restoration of services.  However, now that it is done remotely, it is a flip of the switch and the cost to do such, at best could not be in excess of $5.00.\n\n Now, the Maricopa City Counsel is fully aware of the historic, corrupt and abusive policies of GW, but does absolutely nothing to restrict their abuses when it can through City Ordinances.  Next, we are in a State where Private Sector is suppose to perform much better than public utilities.  However, my experience has shown that the above cities are much better at governing water policies.  The ACC recognizes that GW is one of the most disruptive water service providers in the State of Arizona, yet it does nothing either.

My primary care physician referred me to Dr. Batlan about 18 months ago after I experienced a debilitating episode while engaging in some heavy gardening around my home. I was barely able to ride in my car, even with my wife driving me and my primary care physician provided me with enough extra-strong pain killers to see me through until I could get into see Dr. Batlan (which was only a matter of a few days).\nDr. Batlan was extremely sympathetic, and prescribed a more effective pain medication while getting me scheduled for a series of MRIs, and getting me on the surgical schedule for epidural injections (I'm somewhat 'pill phobic' when it comes to long term medication).\nLong story short, the epidurals worked wonders, as did a 'use as needed' corset type back brace. \nI've continued to see Dr. Batlan as I've experienced periodic flare ups over the last 18 months, and have found him to be very helpful in directing me to specific physical therapy regimes I can use at home that have helped to significantly reduce my pain flare ups. Although I understand that my back isn't going to magically heal itself and that I may eventually require some type of interventional surgery, Dr. Batlan will continue to be my go-to doctor for this issue. Let me also commend his administrative and medical support staff for always treating me like an actual person rather than a number. \nIf you need a caring, technically astute physician to help you with a pain management issue, look no further.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I've only done a few Yelp reviews ever but since the owner of Xamusa insists I do one, here it is. I was happy with paying the advertised Craigslist price for their built in refrigerator but the condition and customer service from Xamusa was horrible. The frig was delivered with deep scratches inside and a broken drawer. A replacement drawer and touch up paint was promised but still not received after 3 months of asking for it. This refrigerator was advertised as like new condition with a full 6 month warranty and was assured it was in perfect condition both mechanically and cosmetically from the owner of the company. First week after delivery it leaked water ruining the hardwood flooring underneath and a few weeks later the compressor went out loosing all groceries.  After 2 1\/2 months of this refrigerator not working, repairs were done with used parts and the unit is still not working correctly. Just yesterday when I contacted the owner of Xamusa about the frig still not staying cool inside he told me the warranty was voided, this was the second time he has tried to void the warranty. He said not to call or contact him again and to call someone else for the repair leaving me high and dry. His claim to void the warranty this time he said was because I refused to pay the travel fee on the compressor warranty call, that's not what happened. I tried to pay with a credit card before the technician left but was told it was to late at night to call in the payment and the owner would call me the next day for it. The first time he tried to void my warranty was because I had not given a positive yelp review.  This was two weeks into the 6 month warranty and there were problems with the refrigerator already surfacing, not to mention he never said anything to me about giving a review, it was not in the ad with the warranty information or in writing, but I was told multiple times after that I had to give a positive yelp review. Seeing only three other yelp reviews in the Phx area confirms this is not a warranty requirement.

Elements of Japanese style like mon seals, brocade, daruma dolls, kimono printed glass and lattice walls made the space really exotic and atmospheric. \n\nWe sat at the bar, so I didn't have the full sit-down meal experience. I did do a tour around the restaurant first and saw the private dining room, the fancy Robata grill imported from Japan and the sushi chefs all lined up, knives gleaming, waiting for the dinner orders to start. Everything looked impeccable. \n\nThe cocktails are really different from the standard: I had a Gin-sing martini, which contained gin, ginseng, ginger and vanilla foam, garnished with edible flowers. Sounds weird but it was so good. Apparently the drink menu was devised by a Bar Chef bartender. I watched the bar staff create some very interesting mixes indeed:  the cocktails are each $14 but for once, I think the price suits the amount of innovation and effort involved. The highballs are served on a large globe of ice, which I haven't seen done anywhere outside of Japan. We also had shots of sake ($6 to $8) - I love my cold, milky Nigori! I think Ame is going to be a very good spot for a posh drink or two, even if not for a whole meal.\n\nThe food menu is not extensive. There are about five or six items in each of nine menu categories. Since we were just having a snack at the bar, I didn't try any of the entree-sized dishes. First, we had the scallop sashimi ($12). What we got was beautifully presented but it was not what was expected. The scallops were tossed in a sesame cream with wakame. I had been craving the cool cleanness of straight-up sashimi. So... the lesson here is that the sashimi dishes are not regular slices of fish on a plate - they are more complicated dishes which incorporate sashimi. Next, we tried the kabocha tempura ($10). It was served on a bed of nails and it was absolutely the best tempura I've ever had. \n\nI intend to get back to Ame soon to try the duck curry and the unagi ramen, along with a couple more of those unique cocktails.","useful":8,"funny":0,"cool":4,"type":"review"}

Took it in again a month afterwards, and the guy on the phone said that they were \"worn through already\" and that \"they would replace them for free.\"  Right.

I am very surprised that brake work, and brakes can be replaced (apparently replaced twice) and the calipers cannot be inspected.  So, they were fixed.  Still has issues.  This time we bring it to another brake place, and apparently a special coating is supposed to be applied as a last step of a brake install, and this was not done.  This caused friction and noise.    Applied the coating, no issues since.  \n\nPrior to this experience, I also had my brakes done.

Then when I was in auto service. It didn't get any better. 2) lack of knowledge of who was the correct person to help me with what I needed done. The person at the auto desk didn't acknowledge me. He wasn't able to assist more than one customer obviously but the least they should do is acknowledge you and give how a time frame of when they will get to you. 3)finally I was told I needed to go to servicing. Some big fat guy was on a personal call. Didn't even ask what I needed. So I went to the cashier in auto services and she was the only person  who got to the bottom of trying to help me. Even then she was confused as to why I was told to come to auto service dept. When all I needed was a bicycle repair. Making a customer wait unnecessarily and not giving correct information is a total waste of time. At the end of it all I didn't even get the service I needed. I came out so distressed with a poor experience of Canadian tire. This is why I would rather go to home Depot, Rona, Lowes etc.. No one ever knows what they're doing at Canadian Tire.

The restaurants are more about ambiance and being seen than it is for good food.\n\nDYNE on Avenue came across my radar when I had heard about the over-the-top Chef's Last Meal; a 34 oz. ribeye with not one, but two lobes of foie gras, butter-poached lobster and all the fixings for $325 which owner and executive chef Richard Andino tells me has fed as little as two and as many as six.\n\nThe ambiance is relaxing, intimate and makes for a romantic date night.  Sink into a plush velvet banquette while admiring the details of the dÃ©cor (my favourite being the mirror above the bar which reflects the window and patio) of DYNE. The background music features a great list of throwback tunes from the 70s to 90s that will have you bopping in your chair while being just the right volume to still carry on conversation.  The private dining room upstairs in this Victorian-house converted restaurant can host up to 46.\n\nThe menu divides appetizers into hot\/cold and then leads into entrÃ©es listed by type of protein.  The food is spun-off from Portuguese and Spanish classics and often feature an infusion of Asian flavours. The wine list highlights Portugal\/Spain but you will find a few Ontario wines as well.  The cocktail list makes it hard for one to decide which to get as they all sound delicious!\n\nAndino, who is no stranger to the restaurant business (having started as a busser at the age of 19) and since worked his way up the ranks; all the way to executive chef at Mark McEwan's North 44.  In the kitchen is former Canoe sous-chef Julie Marteleira who shows that the kitchen is not just a man's world.\n\nDrawing from her Portuguese roots, she wows me with Sardines, served with egg, cherry gastrique, Serrano ham and chili-garlic rice.  The combo sounds seemingly strange on paper but you won't need any convincing once you've tasted it.  The slight sweetness and tartness of the cherries works really well with the saltiness of the Serrano.  The sardines are seared to a golden brown and the words \"fishy\" don't even cross your mind.\n\nThe Pan Con Tomate is one of the best I've had as the freshness of the Heirloom tomatoes and simplicity of buttered bread served with thin slices of Serrano makes it hard to resist not filling up on carbs before the mains arrive.\n\nThe Smoked Oysters with chicarrÃ³n are served with pickled daikon and vinaigrette and the mesquite, tart and sweet elements come together really well.\n\nFor mains, the Angus Beef Ribeye with Asian chimichurri, scallions, Romesco, fingerlings, oyster mushrooms and sweet corn gives me a taste of what to expect when I return with my posse to experience the Chef's Last Meal (which I am now even more convinced to do).  The steak is seared to a perfect medium rare and the sweetness of the corn cuts some of the richness inherent in a steak.\n\nOn the lighter side of things, the Swordfish with bacon, pearl onions, parsley and egg which draw inspiration from traditional Spanish\/Portuguese cod dishes.  The bacon added great flavour to the dish.\n\nDesserts feature items such as Pastel de Huevo; a sponge cake topped with almond cream which is a light way to end the evening.  The only dilemma we have is trying to scrape off every bit of the sponge cake without eating the parchment paper that it so stubbornly clings to.\n\n\nThe Torrija is also a favourite of mine; caramelized brioche with whipped cream and sweet milk.  At first glance, they look like pan seared scallops which gives me an idea for my next April Fool's Day menu!\n\nThe dream team that sees Andino as entertaining host and Marteleira as tummy pleaser is definitely a win in my books.  If you want to experience full-flavoured food and have a good time, then DYNE is the place to go.\n\n\"IbericÃ³ ham is good, but when it costs $800 a leg and you have to charge for it...\" says Andino and when \"paying $40 for charcuterie and a glass of wine isn't Toronto,\" says Marteleira as we discuss why things like the famed IbericÃ³ ham are not on the menu.    DYNE's philosophy is simply to cook good food and to make sure everyone has a good time.  At the end of our discussion we all agree - good food is good food.  You start with quality (not necessarily expensive) ingredients and it will do all the talking on the plate.\n\nTIP: There is currently a great Groupon promotion going on - 2 can dine for $59.

Awful experiences each time we have been to Pro Bikes in Monroeville \nFirst experiences were a few weeks ago. We were in the market to get a new bike for my fiancÃ©.  We are just getting in to biking so we budgeted around 400 to 500.  We walked around the store amazed at the overpriced bikes and we were shocked at the minimal selection within our price range.\nWe finally got waited on ( they ignore you unless you are in the pricy bike area) and the salesperson was clearly irritated that we were not looking at bikes that would increase his commissions.  He used every up sell technique. We walked out irritated and drove to Southside, Thick Bikes. We ended up buying an 800 bike.  They listened to us and really cared that we purchased the right bike for our needs.  They provided great customer service. \nSame routine repeated a week or two later when we need a bike accessory for her bike ...Went to Pro Bikes and felt like the invisible guy..no service\n\nFinally.... The final straw that has driven me to write this review...  My older bike needed minor service to the pedal.  First there was a screw up and the older guy at the counter did not properly tag my bike.  I called to check on its status a few days later and I had to play 20 questions with the guy so he could figure out which bike was mine...to then order the part!   Picked up the bike and put it in the garage.   We went riding for the first time after the repair a week later. I guess we needed to do an inspection when we picked up the bike. \nI got on the bike to take a ride on the trail. The chain was off and the breaks were bent to the point that they did not work.   Popped the chain back on but still couldn't ride.   Somehow, my minor service requirement turned in to needing new breaks and other \"tune up\" work to be able to ride with my fiancÃ©. It is now in a different shop for a week for repairs to the \"repairs\" from Pro Bike.  \nSave yourself time and stress... If you live in the east ... It is worth the drive to Southside...

Please observe a lengthy amount of his material to get the full effect of this review. This review is about my first-hand direct experience of Dr. Shaposhnikov and is regarding medical procedures and conditions.\n\nDr. Shaposhnikov is an Endoscopy specialist. His specialty includes Colonoscopy. I presented to Dr. Shaposhnikov with symptoms of diverticulitis and a health insurance membership card . After waiting over an hour passed my initial appointment time and paying hundreds of dollars as co-pay, I learned three things.\n1) Nobody in that office waiting room but me had insurance.\n2) Everybody was there to have a colonoscopy and I could hear everything about everyone else's symptoms and financial condition (or lack of insurance).\n3) I was being charged to pay for everyone else while waiting for everyone else to be seen before me.\n\nMy initial interview with Dr. Shaposhnikov was about 5 minutes. His accent was extreme and hard to understand, and you would imagine after repeating the same things from rote memory to every patient before me the doctor would have learned to improve his English-speaking ability. \n\nCha-ching: another several hundred dollars later and I meet Dr. Shaposhnikov in the hospital for the procedure.

And more bills. Cha-ching! Thousands upon thousands of dollars later... I still have no diagnosis of diverticulitis. I had to go to. Another. doctor. with a Better. accent. To get a . Real. Diagnosis. I guess Dr. Shaposhnikov , in his infinite experience. Had never seen. Or heard of. Diverticulitis.\n\nDr. Shaposhnikov gets 2-stars because he didn't. Kill. Me. \n\nMy advice to you: if you have no insurance, you'll love Dr. Shaposhnikov. Otherwise, get a different referral.","useful":6,"funny":4,"cool":3,"type":"review"}

Maya, Sora etc found in Yelp) in Koreatown to compare the price and stuff like that. But at last I chose here based on my personal preference (would like a Korean-style haircut instead of a Japanese one), and maybe the relatively high number of waiting customers at GOA.\n- Just so you know that I am not a native speaker or a Korean; I am a pretty shy asian generally. Plus I don't quite care about how my hair looks like except they stole all my hair lol ! \n\nFirst Expression: (why they lost one star)\n- When me and my boyfriend walked into the salon, we saw a lot of customers sitting on the sofas waiting for a haircut! When we wanted to ask for the price list however we can find no one; every staff there were working hard on their job.\n- Finally! We waited for a chance to speak to one of them! (It depends though, since we were quite shy maybe so we started off like that haha) We booked an appointment and we went back after 2 hours.\nP.S. the stylist spoke English to us politely \n\nJorney begins: \n- Once I settled my coat at the \"hanger corner\" I followed my stylist to one of the chairs. \n- And we will discuss about how she could do for me: she asked me how much do I want to cut to (Just showed her) and do I want layers or no (Just say yes\/no)\n- Then I showed her a photo for how I would like to cut my bangs. (Basically it is \"see-through bang\" that is popular in Korea) She got it faster than I think (with just a glimpse of my provided photo!)\n- Suggestions: Like some of the Yelp reviews, I would also suggest bringing a photo with you to let your stylist know exactly what you want. Also in my opinion, it's not difficult to communicate with my stylist using simple yes and no english (unless you want complex style:( still you could show photos!!)\n- After that another male staff lead me to wash my hair first. Since I have seriously damaged hair that my hair tangled like a mess after the wash, they offered me another wash with a different shampoo. I think he did a better job than what I read in the Yelp reviews; he carefully put a towel over my eyes to avoid water spashing, and the water temperature was just warm enough. Even when my stylist (yes, both the male staff and female stylist washed my hair) used cold water for some reason, she would acknowledge me first before washing. (Note: she might say Korean, but you will know when you hear \"cold\" :))\n- Then my stylist started her job. I couldn't comment on anything about the process because I am not a professional, but at least I would like to say that the journey was enjoyable. I just let them to cut my hair as she wanted since I know once I decided to go into this salon this means that I have given all my confidence and trust to them. \n- At last, my stylist asked me what style do I want to finish the look: curl or straight.(Got it done and you're good to go!)\n\nSome comments:\n- Service \nService was actually great for me as well as my friend, except they won't chat with you a lot (but I am totally okay with this cos as I have said that I am quite shy) For those who want talkative stylists that will communicate well with you about how they treat your hair, or anything else, this salon might not be your choice if you are not Korean. From what I observed they all did treated Koreans or those who can speak korean well :) Second, good service because they also came and asked if we wanted some drinks:)\n\n- Quality\nSo at last they didn't steal all my hair for sure haha! So I am quite satisfied already since I have no expectations for my haircut that I just want a haircut. However, at a third-person perspective, my boyfriend actually told me that my hair looks exactly like the photo I showed the stylist! This surprised me too haha!\nFor the hair treatment, my hair actually became smoother immediately! The treatment just lasted for around half an hour. After that, my stylist even asked me to touch my hair to feel the improved, different texture! One last note: I will come back again when I need another treatment or just a haircut:)\nFor my boyfriend 's haircut, he is also satisfied with his except the fact that they didn't clean the hair left on his neck. That made him quite uncomfortable at that time. But in overall, his haircut was done quite fast like an hour with quality. (His stylist is the same as mine)\n\n- Price\nSince they have Christmas discount, my haircut(plus hair wash) and a hair treatment costs $100 in total.\n\nLastly I just want to suggest that if you would like to go to this salon and have a try, just tell your that you are a visitor in Korea! (So that it is not a must for them to speak English in their \"own country\") Try to feel their culture at another perspective maybe you might find something fantastic or interesting :)","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I'd rather go a bit further to get better sushi.   I'm so disappointed because I've been looking forward to decent sushi place at this section of Danforth.\n\nThey had $11 and $13 lunch specials but nothing was that appealing to me (mostly cooked things and California or shrimp rolls) so I thought I would try my favourite sushi item, Spicy Salmon Roll, to see how it stacked up.   I had my toddler with me so I ordered an avocado and yam tempura roll for us to share.\n\nThe salmon was that mushy chopped up kind as opposed to some nice pieces that you can bite into.  The texture was not for me and did not satisfy my desire for biting into a piece of salmon!  The avocado in the other roll was on the unripe side and not as creamy and sweet as you'd like it be.  The yam tempura in the roll was fine and was topped with a few slices of yam tempura.\n\nThe three rolls plus a pop, tax and tip was $24 which I thought was a lot for 1.5 people!  Because I didn't get the lunch special I didn't any salad or soup, which was fine, but just thought was worth mentioning.\n\nMany of their sushi items had cooked items (crab, shrimp) and cream cheese (yuck!).

On 9\/1, I took my 11 year old maltese to see why she was losing so much weight. The first vet did a senior blood panel. On the 2nd, she left a message that had no sense of urgency with the results. When I called back, she told me Jazzy had diabetes, to start her on 1 unit of insulin (my third dog has been a diabetic for years so I knew what to do) and to bring her back in 7 days. But Jazzy wasn't eating so I gave her a half a unit so as not to drop her too low. The next day (the 3rd), she was not eating, drinking or getting up to greet me. I called and said I think it was time to put her down. I go in with her, thinking she's had diabetes for a lot longer than I thought and there was no option at this point. THAT is when the second vet I saw told me she had PANCREATITIS in addition to the diabetes AND a heart murmer! Why would the first vet not even tell me let alone tell me to rush her back in on Wednesday? Pancreatitis is very painful!!! \nNOW, we are dealing with early cataracts, cushings, diabetes, pancreatitis and a heart murmer but...the second vet says...it's possible she could recover well but tells me she'd support the decision to put her down. I was so incredibly torn and it was about the money. I only had about $2k left in savings and another dog at home who also has issues. I am left alone and when the vet comes back, I ask her much it would be to try and save her - she tells me $2200 - $2500. I am torn with what to do because I think I have to pay it THAT NIGHT. At no time, did this vet or any other person at the office tell me that they offered interest free payment plans for situations just as this. I found out when I called on 9\/14 asking if my lil' girl's remains were back and heard it when they stuck me on hold. When they came back on - they said, \"Oh, yes... they've been here.\" BEEN THERE? Why wasn't I called that they were back? And why wasn't I told I HAD AN OPTION...ESPECIALLY WHEN I ASKED THE VET STRAIGHT AWAY! I was under the impression I had to pay everything up front at that precise moment. After the move here and everything being so expensive in Arizona, I wasn't willing to deplete the savings account because I had a third dog at home. I even told her their older brother passed on 6\/11 from lung cancer after a year of battling it with chemo and I was not willing to lose another dog so soon! WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME? Why didn't you give me that option? I was absolutely willing to help her if it meant not depleting the savings account. I have a job - I could have paid it. I just didn't have it all THAT NIGHT when I thought I had to have it! HOW DARE YOU PUT ME IN THAT POSITION WHEN THERE WAS AN OPTION! I'm so sick of this new generation of incompetents. They just don't care. AT ALL. They all seem to think they can just make bad judgements and then just say sorry afterwards. IF YOU HAD GIVEN ME THAT OPTION and she didn't make it - At least I knew I tried. But you never gave me the option and I felt I had no choice. And then your office has the unmitigated gall not to even call me when her ashes were returned? I suppose I'm also to be a mind reader in addition to automatically knowing your policies and being a vet to know what she REALLY had? I have no words that can describe how utterly disgusted I am at those two vets and that practice overall. I am SICK TO MY STOMACH that I put my lil' girl down because no one told me the payment plan was an option. I said I wanted to talk to that vet. She has yet to call me. They wanted me to talk to the Office Manager. But the office manager wasn't available that night and didn't see me holding on to my lil' girl thinking I had no other option but to put her down and the office manager didn't race in to save the day. IT WAS UP TO THAT VET TO TELL ME WHEN SHE SAW ME SO DISTRAUGHT WITH THAT CHOICE. I haven't stopped crying since last night! That vet KNEW I was torn and that it was all over the money. She should have and could have said something...she chose not too. She didn't say, \"It's about $2k to $2500 but if it'll help, we have an interest free payment plan\" because if she did.... I WOULD NOT HAVE PUT MY LIL GIRL DOWN. Honestly - there are no good vets in Arizona. They all seem to think it rather a lax profession where mistakes are tolerated and apparently even encouraged.\nI honestly hope you two vets and every employee present that night all experience the heartbreak and remorse I now have to live with for the rest of my life and I hope it haunts you as bad. SO MAKE SURE IF YOU, AS A PET OWNER, GO THERE... YOU INITIATE THE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT OPTIONS BECAUSE THEY AREN'T GOING TO TELL YOU ANYTHING and make sure you have them fax you results so you can see what your dog really has because they won't tell you that either.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

We mixed it with with the Italian sausage and onion and man on man. What a pizza!!! I told the manager who is a female, you have to get out and advertise. Even if you have to stand on the corner and give out free samples. Vegas has a thousand + pizza restaurants and in order to survive as a pizza business here you have to go to the people. Meaning, go set up a booth at a high school football \/ basketball game; get a booth at a busy gas station where traffic is thick and let people sample your pizza. Again, great affordable pizza, but you got to do better with advertising. We will be back!!!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

That's a big difference.  I did call in to let someone know but to be honest they seemed to busy to honestly care that I got a small coffee instead of a medium.  I have started coming inside in the morning because the drive-up lines tend to get long.  As someone that frequents their store weekly I'd suggest having the friendly people at the cash register (they sometimes have a lady that doesn't seem to have any personality, low energy and talks very quietly, not what you'd expect to be greeted with at 6am).

This is especially true for our past experiences with plumbers...\n\nImagine my complete and utter amazement to find an honest, dependable, knowledgeable and all around great plumber: Jerry!! I cannot sing his praises loud enough!!\nWhen my kitchen sink clogged (badly) I turned to Yelp after Angie's List dealt me a real dud the last time I needed help. Jerry came out exactly when he said he would (his first thumbs up in my book) , quoted me a price and then spent hour after hour tackling the problem. With each passing minute my anxiety rose as high as I imagined the bill would be. Turns out the clog wasn't just a clog anymore but a collapsed pipe. Jerry explained that he could pinpoint the location with a camera and maybe then get a snake in to fix the problem but he'd have to come out the next day. I reached for my checkbook (and the Tums) but Jerry stopped me, refusing payment. He further astounded me by saying IF I wanted him to come back and IF it turned out to be the bigger problem - a collapsed pipe - the next day's camera work would be included in that repair - IF I decided to let him fix it. Wow! He patiently explained worst\/best case scenarios and prices, answered my many questions and gracefully eased my anxiety. \n\nLong story short, it most definitely was a collapsed pipe, right in the middle of my kitchen floor; getting to it involved a saw, a jackhammer and shovels. Jerry and his partner, Danny, worked all day, put in extra effort to make sure that there were no hidden problems and left the area where the hole was dug cleaner than they found it. Three day's work and a price that was unbelievably reasonable. Jerry, I think I love you... :)\n\nIf you need a plumber, look no further. Seriously. Why gamble when we Sin City homeowners finally have a sure thing?","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

With leather booths, dark tiled walls, and a wide bar at the back, it's likely you're in for a comfortable meal.\n\nAside from the market priced meat, everything on the menu is $22 or less and divided under three sections as small\/medium\/large plates.\n\nSMALL PLATES\nThe potted duck (a duck rillette) and the steak tartare, while perfectly fine, weren't especially notable. They are, however, extremely well-priced at $6 and $8, respectively.\n\nMEDIUM PLATES\nThe chorizo corndog - a surprisingly interesting and tasty snack. With pickled onions, egg, and pummery, it's a little spicy with its ground chorizo interior and a a bit crunchy from it's crunchy exterior. A decent-sized snack.\n\nThe hot-smoked trout cakes - three pea pancakes topped with trout and creme fraiche. They were okay, but not a re-order. A serviceable canape.\n\nTheir crispy wings are smoked and fried and come with a house BBQ sauce of consisting of Sirracha and ranch. Really excellent wings - the meat was moist and tender, and even with the saucy sweet and spicy exterior, the skin still retained a bit of crunch from the fryer. Would order these again and almost made me order the fried chicken because of how good they were. But... there was more food coming.\n\nI was very excited to try their tourtiere hand pies and I was not disappointed. A mix of pork and wild boar in a tallow lattice crust and sided with a tomato-cranberry relish. Definitely something to re-order. Quite enjoyed the flavours and the flakiness of the pie pastry.\n\nLARGE PLATES\nThey had a house-made pappardelle with \"cheeky\" ragu on menu and of course, I had to order it. While good, I felt like it wasn't as strong as the other large plates that we ordered. Thought the pasta would go awesome with the stew instead.\n\nMy absolute favourite of the night was the Huntsman stew: braised short rib, venison, and pie dough crackers on the side. Such great and deep meaty flavours, as well as that lovely collagen-thick texture of the stew. A great and hearty winter meal that really needed a beautifully crusty white bread to sop it all up. Still, we made do with the spoon after the crackers were gone.\n\nA surprise for me (though why after the wings) was the fish & chips. A lovely and light tempura batter surrounding a moist and flaky cod. So nicely flavoured and perfectly textured, I didn't even dip into the remoulade sauce! Sided with so-so salt & vinegar fries. Which I mostly ignored in favour of the fish, anyway.\n\nDESSERT\nA very tiny dessert menu: apple pie, lemon tart, and a cheese plate.\n\nThe apple pie was a fried pie reminiscent of the old-school McDonald's treat of yore. Nice, crispy, a little heavy, of good apple taste. Just not my thing.\n\nThe lemon tart was much more my speed and much less a tart than expected. A low jar of lemon cream that was just a shade grainy (though nothing that would impede me from eating it) and with a very nice mellow lemon flavour. This was accompanied by two rather tasty butter (shortbread?) cookies.  I quite enjoyed this one but almost felt that I should have gone for the fried chicken instead.\n\nThey've just opened and are working out some process kinks - so be prepared for a slightly drawn out meal - but this is most certainly worth a visit. A great mid-priced restaurant that's serving up some excellently executed dishes. Overall, this is a definite recommend from me.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":4,"type":"review"}

The decor, the beautiful light fixtures above the bar, the warm wood and low lighting was very welcoming. As you would imagine, a place called the Huntsman was full of...you guessed it...bearded hipsters. Not that that's a bad thing but it was the crowd if you were wondering.\n\nMy BFF and I sat at the bar and drank some wine - not the greatest list but they said they were out of the first two we tried to order because they were changing their list so hopefully when I go back there will be more depth to the selection. We weren't crazy about the bottle we did get but we drank it all the same. We finished up with Jamesons so we made it work!\n\nSo I loved being here and wanted to give this more stars but as a vegetarian looking at a very small menu, there was very little to eat. There was a white bean and kale stew but it didn't interest me. I tried the fish and chips as I eat some fish and really had no other choice. But first I started with a ricotta, roasted tomato and grape green salad with pecans that was pretty bland. The fish and chips was also bland. The tempura batter was ok but there was very little taste to the fish and I was disappointed with the salt and vinegar thin cut fries. My BFF had steak frites and her fries were delicious so if I'm back I'll definitely order the regular fries. She also got this delicious home made ketchup that they had served with her appetizer (corn chorizo dog that she loved) and they gave me regular old Heinz. My BFF liked her steak and corn dogs so perhaps this just isn't the place for a vegetarian. Yes, I see the name is Hunstman and I'm not surprised, but it doesn't account for me being disappointed with not just the choices I had but the actual food. Bland on both courses with mediocre wine.\n\nThat said I just loved being there and am sure I'll be back to try again.

I have eaten at most every location in Western Pennsylvania, including Erie, and even State College.\nThis was my first visit to \"Lakeside,\" and I must say I was completely blown away by the decorative efforts that make this place feel like the inside of a Dia De Los Muertas Holiday Greeting Card . . . Skeletons everywhere . . . I LOVE IT.  There are lots of skeletons in the other, newer Mad Mex locations too, but this one was the most excellent yet, including the skeletons in the Men's room (assuming the same for the Ladies too), and the bar area had the Mexican rendition of Tarot cards painted on the walls . . . Excellente!!\n\nNow, however, the food.  I usually try and eat at least one \"Gobblerito\" each season, sometime between Halloween and Thanksgiving.  It is a limited edition burrito stuffed with all the fixens' of a traditional Thanksgiving dinner, and even has cranberries on the side.  \n\nWhen my burrito arrived, it didn't have that usual \"snappiness\" of a traditional Mad Mex burrito, it looked loose and flabby.  And when I tasted it, I almost felt like this turkey was left-over from last year's Thanksgiving feast.  It honestly didn't taste fresh, and unfortunately, I believe my burrito was prepared in a microwave, as the first bites were luke warm, but when I stuck a bite into my mouth from the center, it actually burnt the inside of my mouth so bad . . . I wanted to spit it out, but there was a table of women sitting right across from me, and I didn't want to ruin their meal by spitting out food across my table . . . so I held it in, and received third-degree burns in the roof of my mouth.  So glad I had ordered the frozen Pumpkin-Apple margarita (which was very tasty by the way) which helped to alleviate the pain, but sitting here writing this the next day, my mouth is still suffering and I can feel the skin molting inside my mouth.\n\nService was a bit slow, for my liking.  I had already known what I wanted to eat when I walked in the door, and I told the hostess I didn't need a menu, but she gave me one anyway.  My actual server took her time getting around to see me, and I was actually feeling a bit hangry when she finally did come over to take my order.   Thankfully the food arrived in a timely manner, but it is a shame that the food didn't meet my expectations.\n\nOverall, I give this place a 5 for ambience, the decorations, and the wonderful view overlooking the lake, but I have to subtract points for the food, so I'm gonna split the difference and go 3 out of 5.  \n\nI will be back to give them another chance, just because I like the location so much, and I also happened to receive a postcard in the mail just yesterday for a free burrito to help celebrate Mad Mex's 23rd (WOW, have I been eating this food for 23 years?) Anniversary from November 27th - December 8th.  Ole'","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I've collected coins since I was 8 years old and had a pretty good idea of what the market would be for this particular collection.  After a quick phone call to C&C to determine their level of interest, I was invited to the shop to let them examine my coins and price them out.  We set up a time and day that was mutually acceptable.  The shop was closed on this day of the week to allow staff to work up their inventory and other duties, so we had complete privacy during the transaction\n\nI dealt mostly with one of the owners, Ken Moon.  Ken was very open about pricing and grading and we had a pleasant morning discussing a broad range of topics, some of which was actually about the value of the collection I was wanting to sell.  Subject to examining the sets, Ken made me an offer that I felt was more than fair, and we closed the deal on a handshake.  They examined the items, confirmed grading, and there was no backtracking on price. He cut me a check and the transaction was concluded.  Simple as that.\n\nTo be honest, when I walked into the shop, I expected the usual \"beat down\" on price that dealers usually try to get the price down.  That didn't happen.  Ken showed me the spot prices, made adjustments for the numismatic value, and quoted me an offering price.  It was fair and there was no haggling.  \n\nI highly recommend C&C Coin and Stamp.  I don't usually bother to write up these kind of reviews.

This is normally a asian trend where you & ur beloved will have the opportunity to select a certain package, normally 2 bridal gowns, an evening gown & photographed in an indoor (backgrounds) or outdoor setting. Some ppl find it a little fake (cuz u are photoshopped a bit) but we wanted to experience this as it's not something you can do everyday. The pics will then be used at the wedding reception, hang at home, etc. You will get a hardcover book, cd of pics, etc.\n\nI selected Amour as my final choice as they were very pleasant to deal with. Joanne was very calm & wasn't pushy at all. I got a pretty good deal imho as I changed my package a bit & will get 4 change of outfits :D 2 bridal gowns, 1 evening gown & 1 traditional Chinese outfit. I also liked the quality of their photos & backdrops (i prefer indoor photos... yes it fake but it's awesome lol). Honestly... the best place to do this sort of thing woudl be in taiwan. Sadly,there is nothing in the same league in Toronto. But it's good enough unless you want to fly to Asia.\n\nI will have my photoshoot soon  & will see how they are :D But so far it's been a great experience. The gowns they carry are San Patrick, jasmine, Private label by G, Ella Rosa, etc. \n\nThey have other packages too where you can rent an evening gown, bridal gown & traditional Chinese outfit for $1000 or so. Again, this will most likely benefit an asian bride as there are usually a few dress changes during the reception, tea ceremony, etc. I believe they said they would rent bridal gowns for $ 600. Amour also takes photos on your wedding day. I think the photographer is good. However, I am finicky & prefer to have photos in a photojournalistic manner & they don't really do that sort of thing. If you don't care and only like point and shoot this is the way to go.","useful":4,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Badass burger - Saint, 7.99\nSwiss cheese, green leaf lettuce, tomatoes, grilled onions and mushroms, bacon, fried and and sin sauce\n2. Crispy chicken salad, 6.99\nMixed greens, red onions, carrots, tomato, cheddar cheese, wonton strips, and Caesar dressing\n3. Oreo shake, 4.49 \nHand scooped\n4. Onion rings, 3.99 \nHandmade fresh daily \nfor 3.74 (Used the $10 Groupon valued at $20)\n\n- Near Walmart. Centennial Plaza.\n- There are 3 signatures to chose from and you can get it either angel, saint, or sinner meaning 1, 2, 3 patties respectively. \n- 100% angus beef patty was thin and lacked flavor. Barely any mushrooms. Bacon cut thick and not thin, making it not crispy. Ironically, the SinCity Burger at SmashBurger, IMO, taste juicier and more flavorful that the name of this restaurant. \n- Burger presented nicely, but difficult to eat and gets sloppy. Put a toothpick! To balance, we used the lettuce and tomato from the salad with the burger\n- Lackluster crispy chicken salad. I eat better prepared chicken salads at Fresh and Easy. Even the McSalad is better. Salad here is prepared like the pre-made bagged salad you can pick up at Smith's next to the vegetable section! Chicken was far from crispy. \n- Onion rings were a bit too flaky. When dipped in ketchup, the batter would fall off leaving only  onion between my fingers, an oily onion. \n- Oreo shake was thick and creamery throughout the last drop. Good recommendation. Although, I still think the Carl's Jr Oreo shake is a bit better bc it taste the same, but cheaper. \n- No ready napkins. No small container for sauces. Everyone uses same greasy hot sauce bottles. haha. \n- Redeeming quality was that it was a enough to adequately satiate 2 for about $14, which is great when comparing to casual fast food (smash, 5 guys, fat burger etc)","useful":5,"funny":2,"cool":4,"type":"review"}

There also is an off putting smell to the place that is a cross between some kind of industrial cleaner and something else I can't quite place..maybe the smell of broken dreams...  The bartender is so obviously uninterested and apathetic that you can feel the contempt he obviously has for the customers and the disappointment in where he finds himself.  I ask for a guinness and they don't have one nor do they suggest a suitable alternative.  Annie gets a pretty awful vodka\/tonic and I settle on a shiraz,,,maybe the worst glass of wine I've ever had in a restaurant.  It was just gross.  Annie orders a pizza, which truthfully was edible.  I mean it was cheese, marinara and soggy crust.  I had the hot tapas steak and fries,,,which took close to an hour to receive with no apology.

But this shop is better than just a cloth diaper store (although it's great at that). It's a fantastic full-service baby boutique, catering to the crunchy side of the mama (or should I say maman?) spectrum, but very all-encompassing and welcoming. They probably won't even look at you funny if you mention formula feeding or your scheduled c-section. Probably.\n\nThey have a fantastic selection of baby carriers\/wraps and offer instructions on using them, which is an awesome resource to have available, considering how babywearing-friendly Montreal seems to be. Great to have information on hand in a friendly setting. They also have toys and teethers and all sorts of other natural and baby-friendly things.\n\nWhat sent me into Bummis, though, was a case of seriously stinky diapers. I cloth diaper my kid, but soon after moving to Montreal, a formerly unnoticeable diaper pail suddenly had a nasty ammonia reek. Maybe it was the water, maybe it was the kid, maybe the detergent, maybe the different washing machine, maybe the diapers. All I knew was it had to go, and I couldn't change the kid or the water, didn't want to buy all new diapers or a new washing machine, but could stand buying fancy detergent if it would fix my problem. So I looked up online, learned about Rockin' Green, and saw that Bummis stocked it. \n\nI went in and spoke with one woman, who quickly turned me over to someone else with more funky diaper expertise. This second woman was amazing. She helped me troubleshoot my problem, suggested that no, I likely didn't need to buy a $30 bottle of detergent, but should try the $3 sample first. Maybe I just needed to use more detergent. She even gave me a free water test strip, to see if my water was hard as I suspected (it was). \n\nI felt bad, because I would have happily given them the larger sale, but I'm so glad that their sage advice fixed my stinky diaper problem, for cheap! So, thank you, Bummis!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I knew this ahead of time so I waited until I had an opportunity to host a work dinner.  So this week I had a customer come to town and took him and my partner.  We went early (~5:30) because we were going to a hornets game afterwards.  I assumed I wouldn't need a reservation at that early hour but when we arrived the hostess said she could only seat us at the sushi bar.  I called her bluff and said we'd go somewhere else and the manager who happened to be standing next to her seated us at a table.  We ordered a some apps, which were good but teeny tiny, and the sushi was fine but I don't think I could take a pepsi challenge against any other sushi place in town if you took off the fancy presentation.  As expected with cocktails, sake, wine, and 3 hungry diners the bill was astronomical (and the rolls were half off!).  If you're looking to keep costs down stay away from the nigiri.  I'm not a sucker for high end experience and prefer a more casual environment.

I will leave a horrible review on every website I possibly can if it helps someone from moving in here. Let's start with my awful neighbors. The lady on the right of me is constantly threatening me and cursing me down as I walk by. I don't even think we have ever had a conversation so I don't understand why she does this to me. She is always drunk or high and getting those smells into my apartment. When she opens her door all I smell is weed and cigarettes. She also broke into my neighbors house and stole her food stamps card and pain pills. The guy that lives across from me is a drug dealer. He goes outside about every ten minutes and a car will pull up and he digs in his pockets and does the drug deal and they leave. He also handed off some drugs and talked about how awesome they were when I was on my patio with my best friend and her here year old son. I was very upset that he saw that and I called the office and they said there is nothing they can do. My upstairs neighbors stomp up and down they stairs at all hours of the day and this makes my dog bark. And every time this happens they come to my door and cuss my dog out. They stomp so loudly it wakes me up every morning without fail. When they moved in I also had roaches coming from my ceiling. We dealt with a huge roach infestation due to these neighbors and it has been hell. Apartments did nothing. Everything in my apartment is also broken because everything is so old and outdated. The office staff is VERY rude and could care less about you as long as they get a paycheck. They lost a rent check of mine one time and made me repay it because I didn't get a copy. Never made that mistake again. ALWAYS GET COPIES OF WHATEVER MONEY YOU HAND THEM!!!!!! Parking spaces are also very small, lots of cats, police helicopters fly over almost every night, not safe at all. Landscapers will also wake you up every time they come through. Which is about 8-9am. Do yourself a favor and stay as far away as possible from this hell hole. I only have three weeks left thank god.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Andrea was attentive and listened to what I wanted. Nothing crazy, just a trim and some bangs and root touch up. She applied the color and let is process for 30 minutes. After washing and drying my hair, she noticed that the color didn't take to my stubborn grays. I didn't notice it right away so I appreciate that she didn't try to hide it. Instead she remixed the color and reapplied it. It seemed to take the second time around until I got home and noticed that the color wasn't a very good match and many strands didn't get coverage at all. I would go back right away but processing my hair so much can't be healthy so I have to wait. So while my stylist gave me the cut I wanted, I'm giving Ritual 2 stars because I think their choice of product is not of good quality. I never liked Paul Mitchel products and from now on I will definitely ask other salon what type of products they use before making an appointment. Even though I got a good discount through Yelp, I feel like it was a waste of money because I'll have to dye my hair again to get the look I was hoping for the first time around. I won't be returning there for my hair but maybe I'll try their spa services since I have the discount card. Also the gift card only allows you to redeem a certain amount with each future visit.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Now the boys are in the 1-2 year old class with Ms. Kimmy!!  She is fabulous and has a genuine concern for all of the toddlers!!  She teaches them sign language and gives the kids the love learning that they need.   We really like Sunrise Preschool and would recommend it any parent!!   The price is pretty reasonable too!!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

We got there around 12:30 and it was quite busy but we were seated pretty quickly.\n\nThe ad in the paper boasted about their special hu tieu nam vang so we all decided to order a bowl. I also decided to try out their lychee bubble tea since they had a neon sign saying bubble tea outside...so it must be good, right?\n\nThe bubble tea came out first and I was VERY disappointed. This was the worst bubble tea I had in my entire life. It didn't taste like lychee and there were many ice chunks that didn't get broken down in the blender. We complained about it but all they said was it's supposed to be like and I argued back and all they said was sorry. It was so bad that I only took a few sips...a total waste of $3.15. Next came our hu tieu nam vang that was served with the broth on the side. The hu tieu was very slimy and were stuck to each other. It consisted mostly of huge badly sliced Vietnamese sausage (which shouldn't even be in this type of order), pork, and liver. \n\nWe were VERY disappointed and I have to say that this experience reminded me of the one I had back in December in Alberta. We will definitely not return because the food sucked. The 10% discount didn't even make things better.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Just recently I stopped altogether\n\nFor some reason they don't have enough respect for others, like most....and they don't have enough backbone to tell the disruptive, immature and ignorant customers that are disregarding everyone's existence by yapping on there cell phone at unnecessary volumes, so the rest of us sit in misery. Some people are to sheepish to say anything, others like me trying to avoid a situation resulting from putting someone in there place. I'm trying to work on my intolerance for people and find a way to make myself a better person by not reacting. It's a trial of patience. \n\nWithout fail, it became a standard time of two hours to get a gel mani and a regular pedi - how it the hell it takes so long is beyond me. Employees are always quitting and they always have to call for emergency backup from on-call nail techs because they can't run the business and keep employees around long enough to create what should be a well-oiled machine. It's just nails, there should be no complications. Couldn't be an easier line of work if you asked me.\n\nAnyhow, the end for me was when I had to cut the appt. short and get a regular polish instead of gel on my hands because I couldn't bare to sit in that chair any longer. They assured me nails were dry, and I was careful, but they weren't (of course blamed me for that later) and after all that time, the work that had been done looked like a preschooler did painting. I left, called Kate (who was already aware of what happened) and she said she would fix it.\n\nWhen she was done, she asked the cashier to collect the payment from me - and I said \"YOU'RE GONNA CHARGE ME TO FIX WHAT YOUR STAFF DID WRONG?\" her lame-minded response was, \"Oh, you didn't pay for gel last time\". Well yea! I couldn't sit there another hour waiting for that to happen and it doesn't warrant a bad paint job. She completely danced around the issue. My grandmother has given them close to $400 dollars worth of movies in their language, and we have been loyal for several months ... this is how she treats me.  So sickened - looking forward to the day I run into them again, as I have before, and have them ask me why I don't come in anymore. Sad, but Kate would probably ask and pretend to not know why.

I have used this place several times and have never been disappointed.  My mother took her car to the Honda dealership in Huntersville to get an oil change and they tried telling her that she needed over $1700 worth of work.  When I took it to Graham he showed me that it did not even close to half of the things they said were required.  It is evident that they were taking advantage of my mother because she knew little about cars and is in her 60's.     \n       Murray's Autoworks have been my go to mechanic and has done a tremendous job.  I have been so pleased that I recently took our Buick Enclave to get fixed even though I purchased an extended warranty from Randy Marion in Mooresville who turned out to be a bunch of crooks. \n       It is evident that this business is run by an honest person and that is very hard to find these days.

They could have used someone with an eye for design, as the decor could be classified as thrift-store-restaurant-chic.\n\nWe started out with a hummus appetizer, which also came with kalamata olives, salted pickles, pepperchinis and shug (which is something new I've never had, a mixture of olive oil, cilantro, garlic and chili flake ground together).  The shug was fabulous!  The hummus was tasty, albeit a little chunky.  I prefer a smoother puree.\n\nMy wife ordered the shwarma\/gyro combo, while I went with the shwarma plate with 2 side falafel.  The lunch combos came with an Israeli salad, which never arrived at our table.  Hmmm.\n\nMy wife found the chicken shwarma and gyro meat to be overcooked and dry.  She also though either the chicken or the mayo-based garlic sauce drizzled over it tasted funny.\n\nI got used to the garlic sauce after a couple of bites, and cleaned my plate.  The falafel looked almost like little muffins, and were pretty good.\n\nWe ordered the baklava.  How to describe it in one word?  Dry.  They must have found this bad boy in the Gobi Desert.  Baklava is supposed to be moist with a honey simple syrup, which they must have been short of.\n\nI had to temper my first reaction, which was to call out the kitchen staff and have each of them take a bite while berating them, a-la Gordon Ramsey.

Cobb webbs in every single room. There was BLACK MOLD in the ceiling in the living room (which they just painted over with a completely different shade of paint, so our ceiling looked like a Picasso painting). And part of the kitchen counter was broken off. Most of the light switches were broken. A section of the cabinet in the kitchen was broken off and left a huge gaping hole. The nails in the ceiling of ecery room were coming through. And our fridge door was left open the whole night prior, after our electricity was turned on.

And his wonderful owner didnt train him thats its okay if the wind happens to well, blow. Oh whats that? A leaf moved?! Let me bark at it. The wind blew?! Let me bark at it. A car started?? I need to bark at it. \n\nBut if we called to complain, and if Caprice (pretty sure that was her name) answered, not only would she make you feel like absolute garbage for calling, but she wouldnt do anything about it. And if you went into the office, she would never get off of her lazy bum to help you. But Im pretty sure they decided to let her go 2 months prior to end of our lease.

And theres nothing you can do.\n\nDo you like hearing dogs bark at all hours of the night?

What about loud awful music cause some turd burglar is parked outside of your window blasting music while he waits to pick up his offspring? Oh you dont?

A recent car purchase at Stouffville Hyundai was the smoothest, most efficient and least stressful.  The biggest contributing factor was the sales team that handled the transaction.  First and foremost, salesperson Barbara Wood arranged 2 cars for me to test drive.  She highlighted the features and differences between the 2 models during the test drive.  I stepped into the showroom expecting to receive a promotional retail rebate (per newspaper ad) and an APA rebate between Hyundai Canada, the manufacturer, and a professional association that I belong to.  She agreed to honour both rebates.  During the negotiation process, Barb helped me to negotiate a fair deal that was profitable to the dealership and would fit my budget (I changed to a lower model to accommodate my budget constraint).  Barb Wood is so knowledgeable, friendly, helpful, down-to-earth, and full of positive energy; I would buy my next car from her in a heartbeat.\n\nMy attitude going in was I just wanted a fair transaction, not to make a dealership lose money or allow myself to be ripped off.  Luckily, the sales team I dealt with was agreeable to my attitude (and that was so refreshing).  Aside from Barb, the team included Darren Doner, the General Manager, and Jim Spicer, the New Cars Sales Manager.  Darren is the coolest general manager.  He is instrumental in agreeing to the 2 rebates that I mentioned above.  Jim assisted in locating the model and colour I wanted.  He researched the whole Canada for me.  \n\nThe sales team at Stouffville Hyundai is a great team to deal with.  I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in buying a Hyundai.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

He has great bed side manners, a good communicator, and just overall left me with a good feeling, I felt glad and confident that he was working on my teeth.  \n\nHis tech could use some help.  Although he was a super nice person and knowledgeable and seemed rather experienced, he needs to learn to focus on the task at hand.  He must have taken 5-6 x-rays of the same tooth.  Finally I said \"let's make this our best effort and get it right\" - finally he got it right.  Meanwhile, do I now have cancer from the million x-rays he took?  He also gouged me really good on my inner lower gums, causing my gum skin to tear and bleed.  \n\nCost:  I had 2 root canals done at the same time.  1 was a retreat (not from them), $1500, the 2nd was a 1st time root canal, $900, total bill out the door around $2400.  While I think it's not outrageous, next time I'm likely to shop it out - not just considering price, but considering reviews and will call ahead and compare prices.\n\nIf I were to forget price, Dr. Progoski is hands down the best oral surgeon I've encountered and I've had at least 6 root canals in my lifetime so far.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

There were plenty of people who were vacationing here and I actually had a hard time finding a parking space relatively close to the entrance.\n\nFor $100 for the night, my room had a king sized bed, big bathroom with a shower and tub, living room with a pullout couch, and small kitchen area with a microwave, stove and dining table with chairs. My room did not have any sort of view, but that was fine with me. The lobby area was modern and spacious and there was fresh water with lemon offered to guests. The floor where my room was located was very clean and maintained. Outside of the hotel, there's plenty of dining options including Einstein Bagels and Tequila Mexican Cuisine right next door.\n\nOverall I was pretty satisfied with my stay here. For anyone looking for an upscale place to stay in Las Vegas that's not considered one of the major resort\/casinos, Bluegreen Vacations Club may be for you.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":4,"type":"review"}

The dinner room is large and open. The menu selection has a little for everyone ranging from artisan pasta, several classical french dishes, to burgers.  My mom tried the 3 course tasting menu and I ordered off the menu.  We started with the Thai calamari which has hints of curry and lemon grass and the pate de campagne bourguignon which came with great crusty bread, mustard and homemade pickles. Next, we had linguini de sud, which was a pasta infused with lemon and saffaron and topped with shrimp, clams, and arugula.  My mom ordered a crispy, skin on, sea bass type of fish with fingerling potatoes. And for dessert we ended with the cherry pistachio sundae topped with  butterscotch sauce and marshmellows, but next time, I have my eye on the souffle.

He said he understood.  Two weeks later he came back and left creepy sitting on the patio.  Then he put new chlorine holders in the pool and charged us $25.00 each for them.  When my husband called and said we were not paying for chlorine holders when there was absolutely nothing wrong with the ones we had.  The owner of the company got into a verbal argument with my husband and then proceeded to tell him he was going to come and kick his old ass.  Needless to say he told him to return our key, we were no longer in need of his service.  I would not do service with a company that 1) adds things that are not needed and 2) threatens people's lives.\n\nHopefully he mails our key and refund like he says he will!!  I will post if he does.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I was needing an acid wash. From the moment I made the call to them, to the very end, their customer service has been to notch! Shane educated me on the entire process, and even managed to fit me in the very next morning to acid wash my pool!  They started in the early a.m., and the pool was filled and chemicalized the next day, wow!  Words really cannot describe how amazing this team is.  A picture is worth a thousand words, but in this case, a picture is worth a thousand pool parties!  Thanks again Spotless Pools!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

As far as appearance goes, this place is a hole in the wall (literally in between a dry cleaner and a weave store in the strip mall with bars over the windows) that hasn't been updated in ages and is a little on the dimly-lit side, but I look right past that. Owned by an old Greek couple, this place really falls into the mom & pop category- you can get a salad, burgers, gyro, BLT, seafood, bologna sandwich, even pork chops and country fried steak. They also have breakfast- pancakes, omelettes, country ham, corned beef hash, etc until 11:00 (I think). The food is great, and the prices are even better- lunch is usually under $5. I recommend the pita burger, cheeseburger (juicy fried patties with a soft bun that sops up the perfect amount of grease), or Nicky's Salad (which is HUGE for $5.75).","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

It's definitely a bare bones, in a slightly questionable part of town.. but the food and price is hands down amazing.  Locally owned and operated. I hear the owner is nice. The chef does great things in the kitchen. The staff that i've met is great to the point where we've had in-depth conversations about life, goals and aspirations.. not just.. how's the weather small talk.  It's not rocket-science folks.. you should definitely try it.  There are daily specials. Breakfast, lunch, brunch are the key meals.  I ordered the feta greek omelet which was so tasty, that I ordered the same thing to go.  You get a lot of food- pretty much enough for 2 meals. The omelet comes with grits or home fries- i've had both here and recommend the grits. It also comes with biscuits or toast.. also had both.. and being in the South- you really have to go with the biscuits-- it's their specialty.. anything else is just unheard of!  \n\nGreat portion sizes!\nDelicious food!\nFriendly staff!\nGreat prices!\n=\nWin, win, win!\n\nMy only negative comment is that the hours are not posted.. i've come back several times and they weren't open yet. Also calling the line is a hit or miss.. I wish they had a voicemail recording or at least the ability to leave a message.  That is all folks!  Please try this place.. be open-minded about the location and decor.. and enjoy!  Your appetite will thank me later!","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I think everyone who works there is amazing, happy, pleasant, cheerful. \nI've never had a bad experience and I'm so happy this place exists... \nHighly recommend the Border Benedict - Two poached eggs and seasoned carne asada on top of two sweet corn cakes, smothered in our homemade poblano sauce.
