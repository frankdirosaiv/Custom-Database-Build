When we got there (just after 7pm) we were the only people there.  Paper place mats, folded paper menus, not necessarily the cleanest cutlery I've ever seen.  Service was poor.  The waitress didn't know the menu AT ALL, and was not so attentive.\n\nNot the best prices, either.  $4 for veggie pakora appetizers, $10.50 for my channa masala and $11 for his chicken tikka masala, $3.50 for naan to share.\n\nThe food was pretty awesome.  The pakoras were delicious, and there was a big plate of them.  The chutneys were really good as well.  The entrees were spicy, but not overwhelming.  Very tasty!!  The rice was perfectly cooked, which makes such a big difference.  The garlic naan was definitely the stand-out dish.  Buttery and very garlicky and had a great texture to it.  I would go back and eat just that any time.  \n\nI probably won't come back here, although it was decent.  Still not exactly what I'm looking for.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Two rows of food with an additional row containing some yogurt rice, watermelon, sauces\/dressings and some meh looking fruit pudding.. Needless to say I kept focused on the main two rows.\n\n  As I feasted on several platefuls of delicious goat roganjosh, spicy 'chicken 65' - sometimes with the butter chicken sauce on top, and some excellent chicken tandoori I was pleased to notice several large Indian families come in to eat - aaalways a good sign. Some more highlights include their great egg curry with glazed onions and mango dahl... \n\n  The recipes carry an authenticity to them... 4\/5 stars - Recommended for anyone in the area looking to get some Indian food for lunch. Would give a fifth star for a more competitive price (little high on weekends at $13+ per adult), a slighttlyyy bigger selection, and dinner buffet availability... (All of which can be found at the Indian Oven in Northeast Mesa.) But overall a good bet for lunch in SW Chandler.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

They change their items on the buffet each time, they told me.  \n\nMy kids like the Tandoori chicken. They have melons\/fruits for dessert, too, so the kids like that, as well. And the naan--well, the naan--what can you say about naan? mmmmmm. Naan is a type of Indian bread, in case you've not had it. and it's fantastic here. Waaay too much carbs when you eat here!!  \n\nI asked about the samosas--I have never been able to find small samosas since living in the middle east where they had Indians and Pakistanis on the streets with carts selling samosas (the small ones). I finally asked, and the guy told me they are a specialty item and hard to get. The big ones are easy to get. I don't care for the big ones.\n\nThe downfall to this place--the service isn't the best here. If you order water, they don't keep your glass full, and sometimes it tastes bad and you have to ask for a fresh glass of water. AND, they never know how much the kids are supposed to cost for the buffet. There's no sign for prices,and when you ask, you get a different answer each time!  A few times they didn't charge us for the 1-yr olds' buffet, and the last time we went, we were charged for both kids. I said, I thought he was free (indicating my 1yr old) and the kid serving us got the manager, who was an American female (no Indians to be found manning the floor) and she said there was a charge for each person's meal. Since they are so confused and can't be bothered to give menus or post the prices and ages, we probably won't go back often.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Its quite a large, sprawling bar which is nice enough. As the name suggests it is an Irish bar and popular with the many Irish in Edinburgh.

I like the quirky little barrels for tables and such like.\n\nMy poor friend and I had been in a cheap little bar on the Cowgate where it was a pound a drink (my round, score!).

It is to be found at the end of a side road just after the end of the bridge above your head.  This entry road alone conjures up a spectacular atmosphere - it's almost like the movies where the best clubs are down some shady side street.  This street itself is perfectly safe, but it does do its job in creating a fabulous mood - all it lacks is a haze of mist for you to navigate through on your way to the door.\n\nOnce inside the first thing you'll notice is a vast amount of sporting memorabilia - mostly Irish with a few exception such as a Sunderland shirt above the bar - perhaps donated by Anthony Stokes, but who knows how this shirt came to end up in this collection.  Thanks to its location this pub has managed to maintain a high proportion of Irish patrons and the atmosphere remains distinctly Irish.  Add to this the occasional live music and along with Malones you have one of the best Irish pubs in Edinburgh.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Prices vary depending on flavor.\n\nThey have a discount if you buy 2 bags, the 3rd is free.\n\nThe other slight drawback is the fact that this Montreal location does not take part in special \"flavor of the month\" featured on their official Facebook page. Other locations across Canada offer new, experimental flavors like \"Mac and cheese\" although when I inquired about it, staff was unaware.\n\nStill very recommended, Kernels is far superior to movie theater popcorn, store bought stuff or anything you make at home.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Now I know that I was one of them! La Lingerie is an appointment-only boutique (although there are open house times as well), specifically designed to provide thorough and educational bra fittings as well as browsing time. She made me immediately comfortable -- particularly important in a business like this, because lingerie fittings are very personal. I never felt rushed or exposed, and Katherine spent a lot of time talking with me about what kinds of items would be most useful for me, then making suggestions.\n\nEverything I bought (both that day and by special order -- and yes, she will both ship and file a wishlist for later purchases -- thank goodness, since I just moved out of state!) has been terrific. I haven't noticed any weak spots or wear and tear, and I am so much more comfortable in a bra that fits well.\n\nI'm usually pretty thrifty, and honestly never would have even considered La Lingerie if my husband hadn't treated me to a gift certificate for my birthday. The shop asks that you put $100 down to make an initial fitting appointment, and you should be aware that you are likely to spend at least that much. I considered rating a star down solely for expense, but decided that this experience (and education) was truly worth it! If you've spent years looking for a bra that fits, go see Katherine. Really.","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I'd rather \"buy local\" from a small shop than go to the mall anyways, so I was hoping they'd be ok with me trying on a million pairs to find the right size (I have a hard time finding shoes that fit). They were TERRIFIC! Making sure I left happy was #1 for them, and at no time did I feel like the goal was pushing a sale out the door. My new boots fit great - exactly the right size for me (thanks to several insole tries and various sock weights). I'm wearing my new shoes now - I love them. Plus, I'm always wary of smaller shops charging more or not being as competitive with their pricing; not true. My boots were 10% less than at Soft Moc.

Enter Enzo - I've no idea what their background is, but given that there's one Pizza Pizza down the street, two Pizzaiolos within a 5 min walk, and North Of Brooklyn (their direct competitor) immediately around the corner... let's just say it's a bold move.\n\nOn my way to pick up pizza for the team at NoBo, I dashed in to grab some from Enzo for a direct comparison.\n\nI ordered both the Francesco (mushroom, mozz, olives, sausage, artichokes, roasted red) and Pepe (calabrese pepper, pepperoni, onion, olives). Flavour-wise, they sorta tasted the same, though I want to say I liked Pepe better. Both were decent picks, though I don't have a lot of recall on them - I was distracted by work. I'd probably give both a go again some time to check. Co-workers voiced that they liked North Of Brooklyn better (we also had NoBo's Margh and Puttanesca the same day).\n\nBut *I* clearly liked Enzo enough to return.\n\nSo, I had the Enza (buffalo mozz, fresh basil) today for lunch and really liked this one. The basil was nice and aromatic, the buffalo mozz was fresh and faintly buttery. Photo: https:\/\/twitter.com\/foodpr0n\/status\/328945872253640704\/photo\/1\n\nThe crust: I like. On the thick side of thin and with good chew (more chewy than I think many people may like). The bake is just-toasty, and no significant charred bits. Gives it a nice (and even), crispy, outer shell. Taste of the dough is faintly sweet.\n\nOverall, I like it. I feel the ingredients are good, the dough is tasty, and the cost is moderate (well, on the upper edges of that). Wasn't revelatory as that first bite of Libretto pizza years ago, but it's a good pie. Worth a try if you're in the area.","useful":12,"funny":0,"cool":8,"type":"review"}

Initially I was looking around for their actual store but came across their kiosk on the second floor (near food court) of the mall first. I don't usually like to shop at the kiosk location of any store because I feel like it's too much one-on-one personalized attention, and I assume that their inventory is not as extensive as in the regular store.   But the guy working at the Sunglass Hut kiosk (he's an older guy who used to be a mechanic) was so incredibly helpful, friendly, and low pressure that I'm glad I did.  He had a good selection for what I was looking for, gave great suggestions\/recommendations, and was just all together a super personable and sweet guy.

The supplies (tissues, swabs, cotton balls located on top of the displays with trash cans nearby) to test the products, is just another helpful push to do just that.

There are foundation compacts, eye shadows (singles, doubles, and quads), lipstick, lip glass, lip liners, eye liners, makeup cases, and much more. I don't really care that it's past season stuff. It's not like anyone is going to know unless you're a full fledged makeup artist. (The only other place to go for MAC products, if you want to pay full price are department store like Macy's, Dillard's & Nordstrom. Oops, and the free standing MAC stores, of course.)

I stopped in for lunch and ordered 2 slices (one with pepperoni and olives the other with mushrooms and sausage) and a side salad. Both slices were a nice size, however, the way they were served created an awkward eating situation. Rather than topping two individual slices they topped half of a 4 cut pizza to match my order. The slices were also an odd shape, essentially they were the chode of the pizza world (wider than they were long). This made it nearly impossible to pick them up and eat them by hand without getting sauce from ear to ear. They also violated my number 1 pizza sin and overloaded the slices with cheese. This made for a doughy center were the crust was slightly undercooked. \n\nTheir over loading of the cheese didn't stop at the pizza. My side salad came topped with an honest cup and a half of mozerella cheese. Underneath the white blanket there was a huge handful of red onion, a tomatoe slice, and some bland iceburg. On a positive note, they do make a great homemade vinegarette.\n\nEach day of the week they have a $3 lunch special. One of my co-workers always goes on Wednesday for their lasagna (a portion that may not fit in a shoe box).

We've both been members of Las Vegas Athletic Club for a good number of years now, so it was a tough decision to join Snap. \n\nSnap is not considered a competitor of the usual suspects like 24 Hour, Golds Gym, or LVAC. They're a small chain with more modest amenities. But because of that, they are a LOT less crowded which equates to not having to wait for equipment. The gentleman who signed us up gave us a deal that actually made it as cheap as LVAC (which is arguably the cheapest in town). \n\nOne big draw for us was that Snap is conveniently located across the street from us at work. They have more locations in the Las Vegas area, though usually located on the edges of town. They have locations across the country, also, and your membership works at any of these locations. \n\nThe other big factor was that the gentleman said we can hit pads\/focus mits there, as we both train in Muay Thai. Other gyms would not allow this as they're normally too crowded. \n\nThe only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is that the facility does not have a shower or even a changing room. They do have bathrooms and cubbies to store your belongings in, though. \n\nFor those of you who want a no-frills place to work out and not have to wait for gym equipment, I highly recommend Snap Fitness.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I did a google search to find indoor walking tracks and immediately came upon the Downtown Recreation Center. My parents and sister who have lived here for quite some time had never heard of it and thought I might be mistaken. Luckily, I found out I was quite right.\n\nLocated in downtown Henderson is a fairly new recreation center open to the residents. To use the track alone is $2 a year. Yep, hold yourself back from that steep price. I thought I would start there. So here are the rundowns...\n\nParking - Tons. You can either park in the lot coming off of Basic or off of Van Wagonen. \n\nLocation - Downtown with little traffic. Super easy to get in and out of quickly.\n\nAmenities - [Downstairs] Basketball court, hangout area for kids, racquetball court, women's and men's restrooms with showers, saunas, and steam rooms. \n[Upstairs] Walking\/Running track. Workout equipment on either end with hand weights and tv's. \n\nWhile I know that private gyms can be more equipped and fancier, I have to give this little gym a lot of props. It's got a good variety of equipment, not overly known so isn't always super busy, and the price is more than reasonable ($15\/month). It's also part of the greater Henderson system so you can enjoy classes and other facilities. \n\nIf you live in the area, I definitely recommend checking out this rec center.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

I'd probably keel over dead if someone ever came up and said \"Can I help you?\"  Usually I hear them giving long droning comments about stuff to customers who have no clue what they are talking about. \n\n\nI needed two things in the store.\n\nOne was easy, one was a little tougher.\n\nLets' start with the tough  item.  A USB cable.  USB Mini to USB Micro.  Not the standard cable.  The shelf had lots of items but I couldn't find it.  \n\nI managed to step in front of  an employee who was desperately trying to avoid eye contact.\n\nThe employee glanced at the wall for what could have been 2 seconds \"Well, you will just have to look for it.\"  Thank you Captain Obvious, all this time I was just admiring the wallpaper.  I told them I can't locate it.    Then they said \"Maybe we have some in the back.\"  This was his opportunity to vanish. \n\nAfter a while of waiting I gave up... cornered another employee like a scared cat trying to avoid me.\n\nThe easy item - I needed an Android tablet for one purpose and one purpose only - but not all android tablets can do what I needed -  so I asked what the return policy is.  14 days.  Good. \n\nI asked  for the cheapest android tablet they had - $139.    They were trying to talk me into the $200 samsung.  No thanks..\n\nSorry buddy, I just want the least expensive one.    Again he refers to the more expensive Samsung.  \n\nI don't want the Samsung, I just need any android tablet with a display and I want the least expensive one.  \n\nHe says Sorry we are out of those, but we have one for $149.\n\nHmmm... sounds like bait and switch (which I mention to him)  but I'll take the $149.    \n\nHe spends 10 minutes talking about why I should buy the extended warranty plan.  No thanks. I just want the tablet.  He went on and on about the quality of the tablet. Wow, what a salesman telling me what crap you sell.  Just for laughs I ask him how much the extended warranty is.  $50 for a 2 year warranty (product already has 12 month warranty).  Basically its $50 to replace it between year 1 and 2.  I ask him if he really thinks the odds of this product breaking is 1 in 3 since it is 1\/3 of the price. Again he goes on and on about the low quality.  Since he seems to be ignoring my refusal I the warranty,  I have to get angry and tell him I don't want the warranty, just get me the tablet. \n\nHe disappears and tells me it's the last one.  Whatever.  I'll take it.  He explains no returns on this.  Final sale.  And then he tries to push the $200 one he was pushing in the first place. \n\nThat was it. I was done.  On my way out I saw the employee who was \"looking in the back\" for a USB cable talking with another customer.\n\nI went to Staples - right next door - and had someone offer to help as soon as I came in.  They brought me to someone who knew about tablets right away and I left with one.\n\nI also waved goodbye to Tiger Direct for good. \n\nTiger Direct - 1) Learn about customer service. When a customer walks in say \"Can I help you?\"  When you are busy with a customer acknowledge the fact that there is another customer waiting.  MAKE EYE CONTACT!!!  Hire staff who know about the products AND know how to treat customers.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Na, ob die Realität wohl hält was die Homepage verspricht?\n \nAls wir das Restaurant an einer Strassenecke erreichten luden uns noch viele freie Gartenmöbel aus Metall mit Sitzkissen und Grünzeug auf dem Tisch an dem schönen Sommerabend zum verweilen an der ruhigen Strasse ein (im Laufe des Abends sass es sich aber ziemlich hart und unbequem). Für Gäste die nach 1930 Uhr kamen war es nicht mehr möglich einen Tisch im freien zu bekommen, sie beschlossen teilweise sogar drinnen zu warten. Das Publikum bestand überwiegend eher aus anspruchsvollerem Klientel von Anfang dreißig bis Ende vierzig. Mich zog es erstmal auf die neu renovierte blitz-blanke Toilette in der man vom Laminatboden hätte Essen können. Der Speißerraum Innen wirkte einigermaßen ansprechend, Möbel in dunkelbraunem Holz (erinnerte mich irgendwie an ein Ikeamodell), angenehme Beleuchtung, das Logo des Restaurants an der Wand, ebenfalls super-sauber und frisch renoviert. Wieder draußen angekommen hatten meine Begleiterinnen bereits die Karte von der Bedienung gereicht bekommen und erfahren das Roastbeef und Gazpacho Tagesgerichte sind. Eine Karte für mich kam gleich nach, die zwei höflichen Bedienungen wechselten sich im Verlauf an unserem Tisch ab.\nWir bestellten als Vorspeisen Tomatensuppe, die Gazpacho und mariniertes Gemüse mit Sternschnuppenkäse und Coppa und Salami. Als Hauptgerichte entschieden wir uns für das Roastbeef, die AlbGoldnudeln und Maultaschen mit Kartoffelsalat und Zwiebelschmelze. Dazu eine Flasche Wasser und einen Weißburgunder mit Chardonnay von Salway, die Getränke wurden unmgehend gebracht, der Wein kam mit guter Temperatur im Kühler.\n \nAnschließend gab es als amuse bouche Rote-Beete-Zitronen-Aufstrich mit ein paar Linsen on top und Brot vom Bäcker Bosch (wurde extra so angesagt, der liegt um die Ecke). Der Aufstrich war nichts besonderes, aber okay, das Brot frisch und lecker (eben wie vom guten Bäcker).\n \nDie Vorspeisen kamen zügig. In der wirklich noch unverfälscht nach Tomaten schmeckenden Suppe fand sich ein großer Kleckser Basilikumpesto, schmackhaft aber kein Knaller. Gazpacho gut und fein gewürzt, super für den schwülen Abend. Die Platte mit dem marinierten Gemüse, Sternschnuppenkäse und Coppa und Salami kam wieder mit Brot vom Bäcker Bosch und frischem Grünzeug on top, schön angerichtet. Eigentlich handelte es sich von der Menge eher um ein Hauptgericht, alle Produkte frisch und schmackhaft, besonders das würzige Gemüse, eigentlich war ich dann schon satt.\n \nDie Hauptgerichte ließen ziemlich lange (schätze so dreißig Minuten) auf sich warten, immer wieder lief der Service mit Gerichten für Andere Gäste an unseren Tischen vorbei, die Getränke gingen uns so langsam aus, vovon die geschäftigen Bedienungen relativ lange keine Notiz nahmen bis das Essen schließlich für alle gleichzeitig kam. Aus der Füllung der etwas ungewöhnlich geformten Maultaschen lächelte mich frischer Spinat an, der Kartoffelsalat war warm. Leider alles ein bisschen fad, aber mit Pfeffer nachgewürzt und Zwiebelschmelze auf der jeder Gabel schmeckte es dann doch okay. Das Rostbeef mit Röstaroma war gut, aber auch nicht mehr. Die AlbGoldnudeln dagegen sowohl optisch mit dem bunten Gemüse schön anzusehen als auch geschmacklich ein leckeres, wunderbar leichtes Gericht, genau das Richtige für einen warmen Sommerabend.\n \nDanach waren wir doch ein ziemlich pappsatt und ich war der Einzige der auf Empfehlung der Bedienung noch die Stachelbeergrütze mit Vanilleeis probierte. Es lohnte sich, die Grützenmasse war zwar einen Tick zu süss für meinen Geschmack, schmeckte aber mit den fruchtig-frischen Stachelbeerstückchen und dem feinen selbstgemachten Vanilleeis zusammen wunderbar.\n \nFazit: Ein gutes Restaurant, das überwiegend hält was es verspricht und eine weitere echte Option in der breit gefächerten Restaurantszene der Weststadt die sich sicherlich halten wird. Auch um nur eine Kleinigkeit zu sich zu nehmen und ein Glas Wein zu trinken einen Besuch wert.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Wir hatten reserviert (sollte man auch) und kamen um acht in ein volles Restaurant mit zwei großen Gesellschaften. Es dauerte daher, bis wir uns bemerkbar machen konnten, dann wurden wir aber freundlich begrüßt und an unseren Tisch geführt, der sich zwar am Eingang, aber doch eher am Rande des Geschehens befand. Auch mit Speisekarten wurden wir versorgt.\n \nTrotzdem stöhnten wir innerlich leise. Große Gesellschaften sind in der Regel ebenso laut wie lästig, wenn man nicht selbst dazugehört. An diesem Abend stimmten sie mich allerdings versöhnlich, denn sie waren keines von beidem. Nur der Service war ein bißchen überlastet, deshalb gab es einige Wartezeit bis zur Aufnahme der Bestellung.\n \nAber egal, wir hatten Hunger und orderten. Zum ersten Mal in meinem Leben war ich mit dem Problem konfrontiert, daß das, was mich auf der Karte interessiert hätte, fast komplett auch entweder noch oder bald schon wieder in unserem Kühlschrank zu finden war und ich mich deshalb ein bißchen schwertat, aber das ist nun eher ein Luxusproblem, ich gebe zu, ich habe mich in den letzten Wochen ein bißchen an Spargel jeglicher Couleur überfressen., auch der Bärlauch kam nicht zu kurz und nun ja, Saiblinge werden von meinem Göttergatten öfter eingefordert als unbedingt nötig. Nichts gegen Saiblinge, aber unter meinen Favoriten sind sie nur sehr gute B-Promis. Ich geb's zu, Seefische haben bei mir die Nase vorn. Aber leider liegt Stuttgart halt nicht am Meer.\n \nEgal. Der Rieslingsekt (0,1l für € 4,50) wird mit Brot und Buttermilchcreme schnell gebracht. Alles ist gut (besonders das Brot vom Bäcker Bosch).\n \nDanach kommt der Sauvignon Blanc (€ 6,50 für 0,2l) und Cabernet Dorsa (€ 6,20 ebenso), auch hier ist die Wartezeit ok, dann - hurra - Forellenmousse (€ 12,80) und gratinierter Büffelkäse von der Hohensteiner Hofkäserei, die wir sehr schätzen (€ 12,30), beides mit identischem Salat. Der ist gut: Mischsalat, Petersilie, Rucola, Gurke, Tomate, Paprikawürfel, Radieschen, Alb-Leisa. Mir ist es ein bißchen zu viel Dressing, meinem Mann nicht, und ich kassiere verbale Watschen, als ich grinsend orakele, daß der Schwabe schon gern eher feucht ißt...\n \nBei der Forellenmousse finden sich außerdem zwei fluffige Blätterteigstäbchen, beim Büffel zwei dünne Scheibchen krosses Brot (Richtung Zwieback - Crouton).  Insgesamt wirklich gut.\n \nDanach wird allerdings treudeutsch Brot und Brotteller abgeräumt. Mit dieser überkommenen Sitte werde ich mich in diesem Leben nicht mehr anfreunden, aber ich bin ja nicht hier, um mich aufzuregen, und mir außerdem sicher, daß auf Wunsch weiteres Brot herausgerückt würde. Was sich später auch bestätigt.\n \nDie folgende Pause ist wiederum ok, dann kommen die Hauptgänge. Für mich, die ich die Vorspeisen das Beste vom Essen finde, dann auch der Büffelkäse mit wieder identischem Salat, für meinen Mann Zwiebelrostbraten medium-rare mit Trollingersauce und Spätzle. (€ 22,10).  Der angeschmolzene Büffel ist super und ich proste Helmut Rauscher mit 0,1l Essentiell weiß (€ 3) von der Tageskarte zu. Nochmal der gleiche Salat ist nicht der Brüller, aber ob der Bestellung meine eigene Schuld. Bei meinem Mann ist das Bild auch nicht schlecht: Ich finde, die Spätzle haben ein bißchen wenig Biß (ich schrecke aber selber auch  nicht davor zurück, ihnen etwas Hartweizengrieß unterzujubeln, also bin ich bei Traditionalisten eh disqualifiziert), sind aber offensichtlich handgeschabt, Das Albrind ist wirklich medium-rare, die Sauce gut.\n \nInsomma, auch nach dem zweiten Besuch bleibt es beim ersten Eindruck, die Räumlichkeiten finde ich so lala, es ist relativ laut und die minimalistische Deko gefällt mir nicht, aber es ist stimmig durchgestylt. Aufgrund der Tischnähe würde ich vom romantischen Abend abraten, aber zum Essen mit Freunden oder erprobten Lebens- oder Kampfgenossen bietet es sich an. Die Toiletten  sind toll und neu, Stoffhandtücher hätte ich bei den Preisen nicht erwartet. Der Service ist aufmerksam am Wirbeln, arbeitet aber an den Grenzen der Kapazität.\n \nEin persönliches Kuriosum: Beim Zahlen bekommen wir hinterher noch Jägermeister auf Eis aufs Haus - für mich das erste Mal, und ich stelle fest, da hab ich nichts verpaßt.\n \n \nBedienung\nBei dem absolut vollen Lokal hielten sie sich tapfer und besonders ungeheuer freundlich. Und war auch wirklich kompetent, hier konnten Fragen beantwortet werden. Also endlich mal nicht nur Serviermäuse.\nDas Essen\nDer Anspruch stimmt - frisch, regional, typisch. Beim Rostbraten hat man  nicht noch ein Gemüse zwischen das Fleisch und die Spätzle gequält, das ist dieser Tage ja schon mutig. Viele Gäste waren mit dem Klassiker Linsen-Saiten-Spätz...","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Even with a wedge in your hand, you are looking to land the ball short of the putting surface if you want to wind up putting.\n\nIt is also one of the most dangerous courses I've played. I've never heard \"fore!\" yelled so much on a course before. A lot of the holes run parallel to each other, and tee-boxes are perilously close to greens on some holes. It's definitely a place you want to stay on your toes, and maybe even throw a hard hat in your golf bag.\n\nAll that being said, one of my best moments on a golf course occurred at Sunset Hills earlier this summer. \nMy friend Dave and I were out there one Wednesday afternoon, trying to get in a late 18. It was crowded, and we were waiting on the 2nd tee box when the twosome playing behind us asked if they could join us. \n\nWe said yes, and as they introduced themselves, I found myself looking up at James Worthy, all 6'7\" of him. UNC star and '82 Final Four MVP James Worthy, 3-time NBA Champion and former Laker James Worthy, recently voted one of the top 50 NBA players of all time. I almost fell down.\n\nWorthy just happened to be in town to support of an upcoming golf tournament benefitting the Boys & Girls Club of Gastonia, his hometown, and his friend dragged him over to Sunset for a few holes.\n\nThey only stayed for the front nine, but we had a good time chatting it up between holes. Perhaps most importantly, he was a personable and gracious guy, which is what you hope for out of all your sports heroes.\n\nAs Carolina basketball fans, it was a great moment for Dave and I. As a result, Sunset Hills has become a special place to me. \n\nNot the purest or best maintained course, but for a quick, inexpensive round, you could do worse. \n\nAnd plus, you never know who you might see out there","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":5,"type":"review"}

I do not say this lightly. She did my wedding make up, and took the time to really learn my skin type and shape as she expertly applied make up like a true artist. She noticed my skin was a little dry (something I didn't even know about myself) and took the time to apply just the right moisturizers before moving forward. \n\nSecond, she truly cares about her clients and makes them feel like it. Why hire someone who knows how to do make up, but won't take the time to make sure everything is how it's suppose to be and that you are TRULY happy? She will go above and beyond. How rare and beautiful is that?! It feels like I've met so many beauticians who just want to make money and have no passion for what they do. This is NOT Heather. You can practically see the light in her eyes as she goes from one step to the next! She seems to be so inspired and it's inspiring to be her client.\n\nLastly, Heather is overall just a fun and welcoming person to be around. I had SO much on my mind for my wedding, and she not only was a great conversation but she made me laugh! I can't tell you how much stress she melted away by her hilarious, genuine, down to earth personality. So basically, she is the whole package.

We have been several times to another trampoline park in Scottsdale but we wanted to try Sky Park because it is in the neighborhood. \n\nI can only speak to the \"under 7 area\" and the foam pit, because that is where we spent all of our time. We went during the week, so it was not crowded, which was nice. There were only three other children in the area, but one (according to staff) was the owner's son and he was allowed to jump with his shoes ON and climbed up the trampolines, which (also, according to staff) was not permitted. I was extremely frustrated by this, as it encouraged other children to do the same, then when they were asked to stop were confused.  The staff was young and, apparently, afraid to tell this boy that he needed to follow the rules that were implemented for the safety of all customers. I asked the staff member why she didn't ask him to take his shoes off and why she allowed him to climb when it was against the rules.  Her response was a timid \"he is the owner's son.\"  \n\nThe trampoline area was fun and I liked that they had big sofas for parents to sit and watch the children, but I was disappointed it didn't have at least one bounce house with a slide for the younger kids.  The other park in Scottsdale has an area with two bounce houses (both with slides) and a trampoline area just for younger kids, which is really perfect.  I hope that Sky Park will incorporate this. If not, I am not sure we will be back. \n\nThe foam Pit was nice and well organized by staff member who insisted all the children jump one at a time and wait for the other kids to get out before they jump. He said weekends were \"crazy\" and he felt much safer implementing this policy. I was thankful for the attention to this and his work to keep it both fun and safe for smaller children. \n\nAnother complaint - a sign (and policy?) that reads \"no outside drinks including bottled water.\"  This is outrageous to me. If I am paying to bring my children, I am not going to pay $1 or more for each bottle of water. I understand it is an easy way for them to make money but it will discourage me from ever returning unless they change this policy to allow for water.  I understand not allowing soda, coffee, etc. because of the risk of spilling, but prohibiting water is ridiculous and a poor business decision.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

There was so much wrong that I'll just try to sum it up.  \n\nFirstly, I came here with my neighbor and husband and all our collective kids.  We arrived as they opened and we parked in the parking area right in front of the SkyPark.   And despite that when we left we discovered that we got a warning in the form of a parking map on our car window implying that we weren't supposed to park there if we were attending the church next door; what the heck?? \n\n We went in and I had to sign a waiver that basically said that if my kids kill themselves here on a broken spring, torn fabric, etc. even if it's clearly the fault or failure of SkyPark, that I won't hold them liable for anything, ever, period.  In fact, I'm fairly sure that if one of their employees had snapped and whipped out a machine gun and killed everyone I would have also signed away my rights to legal recourse for that event too.   It definitely not a litigious type, but when the establishment is going out of their way to say no matter how badly screwed up our equipment is, if something happens with our haphazard, poorly maintained equipment it's not on them I get very suspicious and it makes me hyper vigilant about everything.  Indeed I saw reason to be hyper vigilant too.  There was evidence that this place is poorly maintained and struggling, badly.  I saw torn spring guards, ripped trampolines, AC units dripping condensation into 55 gallon trash cans, caution tape draped across whole sections that were off limits, and evidence of general deferred maintenance everywhere.  \n\nI directed my kids to the least threating looking area: a foam pit in the back corner, and made a mental note not to come back here.  Then the kids announced they were hungry so I ventured to the almost bare concession stand in the back and asked about the pizza for $14 they advertised on the marquee above the concession stand.  The bored employee texting on his cell phone looked up long enough to tell me that I needed to just call Mama Mia Pizza in the shopping center and order one since that's where they order their pizzas from anyway.  Confused, I confirmed with him that the process to order a pizza for my family though the SkyPark concession stand was just to call Mamma Mia Pizza and order it myself?  Yep.  That's correct.   Okay, so I'll call Mamma Mia Pizza....  (Review continued at Mamma Mia Pizza)","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

Was promised an estimated time of around 45 minutes to complete my wheel balancing and tire rotation on my car. I waited for almost two hours in the end.\n\nThe technician called me into the service area to show me that my treads were running low and that he recommended we replace all four tires. He was quite correct in his assessment of the tread wear on my tires but after considering my available time schedule, and his quoted price, I opted to  just do the balancing and rotation.\nThe tire replacement quote was in my opinion slightly on the pricey side. Another customer and I rolled our eyes at each other as we overheard another customer being quoted for unexpected repairs to her water pump. It sounded definitely a bit on the high end side. This customer with whom I shared a brief conversation in the waiting area also felt that the quote he got was somewhat high side and even commented to me, out of earshot of the store assistants of course, that he would not be returning here because of the pricey charges. I have to say that I agree with him.\n\nAll this being said, the balancing and rotation was done well on my car; they even took my car for a drive around the block to ensure that the steering shudder I had before was gone. In my experience at least, technicians doing balancing on my wheels usually simply trust that the tires are balanced when the computer says they are. Taking the car for a test drive to confirm it was done properly was going the extra 100yds I'd say.\n\nOverall my opinion is that I think they do good work, at least from the little experience I had with them. They are a little bit pricey though. Would I return? Probably not, I would look for other more cost effective stores. Would I recommend them to someone? In a pinch, perhaps yes, but only in a pinch - if you have the luxury of choice, I'd phone around and get quotes over the phone to see if there are not other alternatives.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

You'll know when you see pictures of pizza.\n\nR.P. is right. The customer service here is above and beyond. The Weekly article had the wrong hours listed (K-Jun closes with the rest of the food court, 9 p.m. on Saturdays). We came in at 9 thinking we had plenty of time. The young gentleman behind the counter, being well-informed, knew we were there because of the mix up. We said we would gladly return during business hours. I mean there's a million great places to eat around there. He then blew my mind. He said he would stay late to make us a pizza. What an insane offer! I felt terrible taking it, but he insisted. So my food companion tipped him well to make his time worth it. He let us order the $20 special. It had a pizza, chicken and two drinks. It's advertised to feed 4+ and it definitely did. He was so generous that I was scared he would get in trouble. I bet he would be the most best friend you could ever have. Someone like this man is such a gem of a person. I would want him to be my partner on Survivor. He even checked on us through our meal.\n\nThe food though is really cool. Korean pizza, HELLO! The bulgogi potato pizza had bits of bulgogi beef, corn, potatoes and other things I'm sure. The pizza sauce was an orangey color and tasted like pasta sauce. The crust seemed to have plenty of cheese  crusties- gooood. It was pretty alright. I wish it came frozen for me to take home. Don't judge me. We had our chicken half plain and half in sauce. I never had chicken like this. The crust is really thick and crunchy. We couldn't put our finger on it and at last we realized it had cinnamon. How cool! We devoured the pickled radishes that came with it. The kind man said they are perfect together. Oh, and he was so right. I love hiiiiim! The other half had a sticky spicy sweet sauce on it. It was good, but I personally prefer the plain. Too messy. The actual chicken pieces come small, but were not dry. I did come across the occasional bone which I find nostalgic.\n\nSo if the Weekly made you curious like me, you should go. I'm remembering and cherishing the time with that chicken , radish and pizza. I'll be back.","useful":14,"funny":9,"cool":10,"type":"review"}

They were fresh, sweet, and crunchy. I never had those things before. \n\nThe Korean Pizza was probably the best thing on the menu. It had sweet potatoes and Korean BBQ beef on it. The beef they got on the pizza is way better than 90% of the Korean restaurants in town. \n\nPersonally, I like the plain chicken over the one with the sauce. \n\nThe portions were pretty big, and they hand batter and fry your chicken the moment you order it. \n\nThis is a pure fusion style restaurant. They also give Tapatio with your chicken and pizza.   Lon L's review was 100% accurate about how the chicken wasn't your traditional Korean fried chicken.   Most Korean fried chickens are very similar to a American southern fried chicken, but with a hint of sesame oil and soy sauce. Traditional Korean fried chicken is prepared by battering the whole chicken without cutting the pieces apart, unlike in America where they batter the individual pieces. Then the whole chicken is flash fried in a pit of boiling oil. After only a couple of seconds they hand you the whole f*cking chicken still in one piece!\n\nWhen I was a little kid in California, I used to eat at this Korean fried chicken place that would actually deep fry the chicken in a combination of Vegetable and  Sesame oil. It was really good.  The chicken here at K-Juns tastes more similar to Tang Su Yuk(spelling). It's covered in a very sticky sweet-sour-spicy sauce. The good news for me is that I really like Tang Su Yuk, so ended up finding the chicken to be enjoyable. \n\nOriginally, I did not want to come here but, my Mom kept insisting on eating here when she came to town recently. My mom went weird a little over a decade ago. She started acting very oddly and her speech pattern became pretty disturbed and strange. While I was driving to Greenland market with her, we had two conversations. The first one was about \"starbucks coffee sent me a free drink coupon\". And the 2nd conversation was about how: \"A friend of mine who is Hawaiian said that K-Jun chicken was bad, so I don't want to eat there\". But, my Mom insisted that she wanted to try it. When we finally got there, she went up to the counter, and incoherently told the worker: \"Starbucks Chicken is bad Hawaiian food\". Now, everywhere my mom goes this happens.   And, everywhere we go people lose there patience with how nutty she is. Workers everywhere can't stand her and get really rude to her.  But, that didn't happen here at K Jun Chicken. The worker was very understanding and sensitive. He never got irritated, never laughed at her, or lost his patience. And he helped my Mom order exactly what she was looking for. It was very nice of him, and I appreciate his kindness. The respectful personality that this worker possesses is exactly what I would expect from a true East Asian person. There used to be a time when Asian-Americans had integrity and honor. We used to respect our elders and not make fun of the disabled. Nowadays a lot of Asian guys here in America(especially the ones around my age) talk all girly and act all snotty, passive-aggressive, and rude to each other. It's literally impossible  to get a long with them.  And a lot of Asian girls are like self-hating(especially at college campuses) and always rant about how they wish they were white and how \"the White man is the superior human being\". Like for example: I had a nightmare situation at a Korean owned sushi place in California where the self-hating Asian girl who was working there immediately let me know that she hated me for being Asian, male, and alive. She didn't even ask me about how many people where in my party, instead she just comes up to me and says all that. Then she kept coming back over and showing me pictures of her white boyfriend on her Iphone, and then started making remarks about how \"Asian guys are ugly and all look alike\". And at the end she made a comment about how Asian men \"oppress women\" and how \"it's not in the white man's nature to treat women badly\".  She wouldn't leave us alone! I believe that if my Mom came into that Sushi restaurant with her mental condition, the Asian chick would have kicked her out. The only reason I stayed was because the owner invited us there that day for a free meal.  And the only reason I haven't left a negative Yelp review on that place is because the owner used to be my next door neighbor. But, moral of this story is that you won't get that kind of treatment here at K-Juns. All you get is respect and good service from traditional East Asian workers. None of that f*cked up sh!t. \n\nOverall, I am happy I came into a Korean restaurant this time and didn't get dissed. Customer service itself deserves 5-stars","useful":7,"funny":7,"cool":6,"type":"review"}

This would happen with no rhyme or reason, disappear randomly (when turning the car off or sometimes while driving) and I was having some noise with the brakes.\n\nAfter giving this to Conant, they took a day to drive it around, had the problem recreate itself, and then hooked it up to the magic machine and reset the sensors which were all (seven of them) reading fail.  The diagnostic showed no actual issues, and they drove it more, trying to figure out where the glitch was.  They kept it another day because they couldn't get it to happen, and still had no luck.  When I came to pick up the car, they refused to bill me because they felt that they didn't actually fix anything other than resetting the computer and that the noise with the brakes was just noise and they weren't grinding or needing work.\n\nPlease, someone find me a mechanic that spends time over two days tinkering with a car, fixing the issue (because the errors haven't happened once in the two weeks since) and then says they won't charge you because they don't think they really did anything worth charging for.

They are honest and upfront about the problems with your car, what it will cost to fix it, and whether or not you should fix it.  Pricing is very reasonable.  \n\nFor example, we had a Chevy cavalier that had a cracked head.  He told me it would cost $1200 to fix it and that it probably wasn't worth it based on the mileage\/year of the car, but they would fix it if we wanted.  We decided not to fix it. You could tell he felt kind of bad for us, and said maybe for $700-$800 he could get it running for another year or so.....which we did decline.\n\nHe has also done some work on our Lincoln, thoroughly investigated the problem, and replaced the rear axle for us, but raised the spector that we should be careful as it was unusal for the axle to rust and he was concerned the car had been flood damaged.  This car also needed a few new cylinders, and again he advised us they could repair it, but it might not be worth it cost-wise for us.\n\nSo my point is: a) they do good work; b) they give good advice; and c) they won't fix your car just to make a buck off of you, when the car might not be worth it in the long run.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The lightly battered prawns were a delight and those Russian roulette peppers made for great entertainment  I got a hot one!! Then there were the cheeses; manchego is always a big tick for me and the goat's cheese with an onion and orange marmalade that I got as the alternative to the meaty paella (which did look tasty and immense!), was a great zingy end to the meal.\n\n\n I'm giving it a 4 star review instead of 5 as I'd like to go back and try a few more of the seafood and vegetarian options to get a full appreciation of the food on offer.

Our friends were in town from Laguna Beach, they naturally wanted to do something that would allow them to experience the beautiful Arizona weather. Once we paid the $16 per person fee for the \"Pick Three\" deal, we stood aside assuming since we told the girl we wanted mini golf first she would assist us with getting our putters and balls and we would go about our day. WRONG! The girl behind the counter went to collecting money from the family of 12 (no exaggeration) that was waiting behind us. Can you believe they actually got all their putters and balls before we even got the consideration of a glance from the employee. \n\nOnce we received our supplies we made our way to the course. Now, I have played at this particular course before and will admit it was an OK time. But this particular time there was a bunch of dead plant material laying in the gutters of what I am sure must have been flowing streams that are now just nonoperational. This must have contributed to the awful stench that closely resembled raw sewage. \n\nBeing that it was hot out, we went back to the concession stand and got drinks and refreshments. The only positive thing I have to say about this experience was the fact that their concession prices were pretty fair. After our quick rest and drinks we were off to the bumper boats to use one of the remaining two activities of our \"Pick Three\" deal. \n\nThere was no line so went went right up to the front. There was not an employee available to help so we waited around for a few minutes before someone finally showed up only to tell us that there were only two bumper boats that were operational. Being that there were five of us, of course, was not really an option. \n\nBy this point, I had decided I was going to make my disappointment know to person in charge. I stopped someone walking by and was directed to the park \"Manager\" who looked to be about 17 or 18 years old soaking wet. I shared my frustration with him and was offered to add more tasks to my \"Pick Three\" offering. That seemed pretty ridiculous considering nothing there was working anyway, so I didn't have to think twice when I declined his extremely generous offer. He then instructed me to visit the Fiddlesticks website and make a complaint to their corporate offices in hopes of getting new battery chargers for the bumper boats. Rest assured I will be contacting the corporate offices by email and sending them a link to this rave review! \n\nSo on to the next event, the go karts. We get in, I push the gas pedal just to be sure that it was working (I was a little gun shy at this point). The kart made a promising vroom vroom vroom and we all took off. After the initial lap was completed it was everyman for himself. Before I could blink an eye, my kart started spitting and sputtering so I pulled off into the \"pit\" and got out and waited the remaining five or six laps for my friends to finish. \n\nOverflowing with frustration, we gathered our crew and left for the day. Each of us out $16 for what I would consider payment for a few hours of my life that I will never get back. \n\nStay away from Fiddlesticks and find something more worthwhile to spend your hard earned dollars on!","useful":6,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Because that's what I'd read about online, you see. Melting, cooling, more chocolate, measuring temperatures - rinse and repeat a million times - to get things just so.\n\nAnd yet, I couldn't imagine that the multitudes of chocolatiers out there were fussing over temperatures and crystal formation like I had over Christmas. I clearly needed some hands-on guidance.\n\nThe first place that came to mind was George Brown. But their Introduction To Chocolate course was overkill - not only was it 11 classes, but it had  a pre-requisite as well. Then I came across Stubbe Chocolates and found their classes to be exactly what I needed: a compact demo with a hands-on component about tempering chocolate. Perfect.\n\nSince most people don't have a giant cooled marble slab at their disposal, the class at Stubbe would teach the widely adopted seed method. We would learn how to properly melt and prepare the chocolate, as well as make our own mendiants and fashion a box made of chocolate to contain them, over the course of two hours.\n\nWith Daniel's calm voice, he guided us through the process while we had some good laughs at are feeble attempts.\n\nIt was a fun evening spent where I was able to learn (and relax) when tempering chocolate - just what I needed. I also managed to snap some great photos (see blog) since the room we were working in was gleamingly bright and white. Thanks to Daniel at Stubbe Chocolates for an informative and entertaining evening.","useful":4,"funny":3,"cool":3,"type":"review"}

Das EBONY war aber so ein Reinfall, dass es unfair wäre, dies Euch nicht mitzuteilen:\n\n\n Als viel gepriesenes Afrikarestaurant, bei dem eine Tischreservierung empfohlen wird, wunderten wir uns, dass donnerstags nur drei Tische besetzt waren. Erfreut über das Glück, bestellten wir das \"Fischfilet\" mit scharfer Tomatensoße, Gemüse, Hirse, und eine Platte mit gekochtem und gebratenem Fleisch mit Okras, Gemüse, Hirse, Soßen.\nNa ja, die Köchin (Frau des Bestizers) muss Langeweile gehabt haben, denn keine 5 Minuten später, stand das trostlos aussehende Essen auf dem Tisch:\nBei dem Fisch\"filet\" handelte es sich nicht um ein filetiertes! , sondern um eine breite Scheibe, die schlicht von einem ganzen Fisches abgeschnitten wurde (wie bei einem Laib Brot) also mitsamt Rückengräte, Haut, Seitenflossen etc., welches total zermatscht (so dass ich es auch nicht mehr zu filetieren vermochte) in einer dicklichen, faden Tomaten?soße lag. Und weil nicht nur im Fisch, sondern auch in der Soße selbst jede Menge Gräten, eine halbe Schwanzflosse und anderes Undefinierbares waren, hatte ich den Eindruck, dass man mir da eine Kelle Restezeug, das als Basis für einen Fischfond gedacht war, auf den Teller gekippt hatte. Die \"Gemüsemischung\" dazu bestand genau aus einer halben Karottenscheibe!! , die wohl auch diesem Font-Eintopf entsprungen sein musste und Hirse. Dann wurde mir ungefragt noch einen kleinen ebenso matschigen grau-grünen Salat nachgereicht, der wohl als Gemüseersatz herhalten musste. \nZur Fleischplatte: das gekochte Fleisch fehlte gänzlich, dafür zwei zu kleine gebratene Stückchen Rind: eines davon war wirklich zart, das andere dafür um so zäher (wurden diese nicht in der gleichen Pfanne gebraten?), das Gemüse bzw. die Okras fehlten gänzlich, an dessen Stelle lag ungefragt ein Längsstück von einer rohen Ananas (zu gebratenem Rind!!!) auf dem Teller dazu ein klitzekleiner Klecks sehr leckere Pfefferminzsoße und Hirse. \nIch mach's kurz: wir hatten anderes auf dem Teller als bestellt! Das Fischgericht sah aus wie der Inhalt eines Schweinekübels, geschmacklich war alles, bis auf den Pfefferminzklecks fad (von afrikanische\/r\/n Exotik\/Gewürzen keine Spur), weitere Aussagen zum Preis-Leistungsverhältnis im EBONY erübrigen sich hiermit.\nAuf meine vorsichtige Reklamation hin, dass das aber kein Fischfilet sei, ließ der Besitzer lediglich über die Bedienung (seine Tochter) ausrichten: Auch Fischfilets haben Gräten! Selbst in Touristenhochburgen habe ich diesen Grad von Ignoranz und Abzocke bisher noch nicht erlebt! \nWir haben oft Afrika (Südafrika, Zentralafrika) bereist, dort auch mit so wunderbaren Menschen (im Dschungel) einfachste, aber schmackhafte Gerichte aus einem Kessel gegessen und ich kann nur sagen: das EBONY hat aber auch gar nichts mit Afrika zu tun.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Are we still supposed to be concerned with it?  Is it still a relevant topic in  the culinary arts? \n\nI'll jump the border and cross the Rio Grande if I want tacos from Mexico. If I just want to eat some quality tacos without the need for a passport, I'll cross the Monongahela and head East. \n\nThis past weekend, after experiencing the Shadyside Arts Festival, Kay and I replenished ourselves at Chica Loca Taco after it captured the corner of my eye several times as we strolled up and down Walnut Street.\n\nNearly stark mad with hunger, I was greeted by an eclectic staff of cheery youngsters and ordered a trio of torridly tantalizing tacos: The Carnitas, The Pescado, and The Cardon.\n\nThe Pescado was the weightiest of the triad and contained a chunk of fish too large to be tilapia (???) that was dressed with slaw, \"quesa fresca,\" and a sort of \"crema\" or mayonnaise. \n\nI found nothing \"dry\" about any of the tacos, from the doubled-up tortilla to all  the vegetables and meats that filled them. The Pescado, with its tender, wet, steamy seafood filet was the feature of our dinner. Saltwater flavors merged with the buttery essence of the dressing and the crunch of the coleslaw, taking me to a tropical paradise of the mind and palate. \n\nThe Cardon contained diced onions and cilantro along with its cubed, grilled steak, and The Carnitas did much the same except with shredded, slow-cooked pork. While the Pescado's inspired, seaborne excellence outshined both, neither of these \"land\" tacos disappointed, both containing supple meats that were complimented by potent aromatics and sharp, crumbled cheese.\n\nMy stomach demanding even more, I also had a bowl of their fatty, chunky, glistening guacamole along with plenty of their auric, brittle and highly flavorful tortilla chips and a slightly bitter, reduced, smoky, and altogether mysterious salsa. The guacamole was neither baby food nor merely chopped avocado. Rather it met the ideal balance between smooth and lumpy, smearing onto each elegant, delicate, and triumphantly unctuous chip like the green lard that it is. And don't read my review the wrong way; I liked the salsa, its taste being one that could be considered acquired even if I picked it up quickly.\n\nKay was gracious enough to allow me a bite of her corn-on-the-cob, a.k.a. Mexican Style Street Corn, and Madre De Dios, I shall NEVER take this summery side-dish for granted again during the remainder of my Earthbound days. You see, I'm used to simply salting and buttering my corn cobs. CLT goes anotha mutha furtha and slathers some sort of \"special sauce\" onto it that recalls Russian Dressing or remoulade, thus shooting it straight up towards Tamoanchan for the old gods to enjoy. And were those fat kernels ever sweet, sweet perfection on a stick, made all the sweeter by the clandestine condiment. \n\nFeeling for fro-yo, we skipped the CLT's gelato and headed to Happy Berry instead. \n\nIf Chica Loca Taco tried to \"fool\" me into thinking they serve optimal tacos, then call me a fool for I was willingly deceived.\n\nP.S. My 3 tacos, Kay's single taco, our chips, our salsa, our guacamole, and 1 bottled beverage for each of us came to $31 and some change. Great grub on the cheap...in opulent Shadyside? It wasn't fast food. It was Chica Loca Taco! Hijole!","useful":14,"funny":11,"cool":11,"type":"review"}

The gal at the counter was so amiable and talkative that I almost thought I'd say what would have improved our meal in person, but I felt like I was being too picky at the time.  But on the walk home with my friend, we both were talking about how though we were too full to stop for yogurt, we really weren't satisfied. \n\nWe tried a four different kinds of tacos and they were ok, the best were the fish and the veggie because they required the least additional seasoning.  The carnitas and the chicken were kind of tough and really lacking seasoning.  The salsas were ok too, I preferred the verde over the house, which we thought was supposed to be medium spice but either my taste buds have built up an incredible tolerance or that was the most bland medium ever.   \n\nOverall this place has a lot of potential, but the food would benefit from more flavor from both more fresh herbs and spices and slightly more salt, especially on the corn tortillas. I think it's a pretty easy fix and also maybe the serving time could be a lot faster, it took about 15 minutes and that's not long for sitting down, but this is a street food concept so it should be quick and there were only two other diners (eating there, but maybe they were slammed with take out?)  I'll for sure be back because it's the only thing like this in the neighborhood and I think I could just ask for extra spice and herbs.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Grocery shopping is definitely a pain, so I tried out Von's grocery delivery service for the first time. I found it easy to arrange, as their website makes choosing products very simple.  I tend to buy mostly produce, and found that  everything I wanted was available.  The only problem I encountered was in updating the number of items in the cart. I would think I had successfully downgraded only to find that I still had multiple numbers of something, or that I still had less than the number I wanted.  I think that's more a function of my being new to the site than a problem on their end.\n\nBefore sending your order in there is a little \"matrix\" where you check the kind of substitution you will accept if your item is unavailable. For example, I wanted a 16 ounce package of pico de gallo, but would accept the same amount made by a different company.\n\nSetting up a time for next-day delivery was simple- you get a window of a couple of hours. My delivery was made right on time by a very friendly guy who had the perishables separated from the non-perishables, and a nice printout of my purchases with the final price on it. He went over my list in order to point out that that a substitution had been made for the pico de gallo- I got two 7-oz containers of a different brand, as they were out of the type I'd chosen. Since I was prepared for possible substitutions, I was fine with that.  \n\nSo, my delivery was timely, the produce was in good shape, the final price was within a couple of dollars or so of the estimated price (they have to allow for produce weight and substitutions so you don't know the exact full price until it's delivered), and the delivery guy was friendly and professional.  \n\nThis delivery was free, but future ones will cost about $15 I believe.  That's really  not bad, considering I'd have to make multiple trips or take a cab at least one way if I shopped on my car-less own.","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

So I went into this store after I saw a pair of shoes in the window that I liked but unfortunately they didn't have my size and it wasn't practical to go back or ship me a pair.   I then saw a sign saying 'Suit, Shirt and Tie for $200' so I talked to the manager, Hicham and he showed the suits that were included.   I asked how good could they really be considering the shirts and ties were selling at approx $40 each and he showed me a previous label of around $699 and that he was getting rid of 'lower quantity stock' that wasn't moving. \nSo I tried on the suit and loved it, but it was a little small in the pants, and the 'next size up's' jacket made me look silly.. This being the case he got the pants altered for me (opened the waist and legs) and they would be ready later that evening.  I chose the shirt that was offered in the deal and bargained another into the deal instead of the tie.   In addition I bought another fancy shirt getting a bit if a further discount for all the purchases. \nSo bottom line, Hicham was very consultative, knowledgeable and never pushy - he made this the best clothes buying experience I can remember in a long while.  I wore the suit and fancy shirt that evening and felt like a million dollars !\n\nAfter I got back home and wore the suit another couple of times I found a problem with the stitching and it would need re-tailored.   I emailed Hicham pictures of the problem and he responded not only fixing the issue to hand but went the next step in making me happy and sending me a gift that made me smile.\n\nI have never had service like this from a clothes retailer.  The stock in the shop is beautiful and I will shop from him again next time I am in town. Way to go !!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Surrounded by a residential area and the ominous glow of Lutheran Hospital, it is not the most ideal location for a restaurant.\n\nStepping into the restaurant, you will notice a lot of blue. As in the bold colored blue walls. The décor is a blend of old-school lounge melded with modern touches and lighting. Service was very gracious and friendly. The space itself is intimate with one small room with jazz performers playing at one end of the room and a bar along the wall of the room.\n\nWent on a Friday night and the restaurant was about half full. Similar type of crowd as at Nighttown. The jazz group, Paul Stranahan Trio was setting up to play at 8:00. Awesome concept, having live jazz Wednesday through Saturday. Sweetness!\n\nDrinks are very affordable. Majority of bottles of wines are in the mid-twenty buck range. Various traditional martinis and mixed drinks offered, as well as own specialty cocktails as well. We got a 25 dollar bottle of Vouvray that was quite nice.\n\nNice assortment of small plates\/appetizers are offered, check out the menu on their website. We were debating getting several small plates a la tapas, as many looked tasty like: peach wedges wrapped with ham and basil, shrimp grapefruit cocktail, gumbo and potato-apple pancakes; but instead opted to go for entrees. The waiter brought us a basket of breads that included a typical baguette style white bread and a tasty nut and raisin bread accompanied by an olive tapenade and sweet butter spread. Both with excellent flavors.\n\nOnto the entrees...the Bell & Evans airline breast chicken was roasted to perfection. Crisp delectable skin covered tender and juicy pieces of breast meat on the inside. One of the most flavorful well-cooked pieces of chicken I have ever had. Mmm-mmm. On the side was roasted, crispy slices of apple wrapped with bacon (must mention again, everything wrapped with bacon makes it better), pureed sweet potatoes (just the right amount of sweetness) and a small pile of sautéed spinach. The juices of the chicken, mixed with the flavor of the bacon and sweetness of the apples created a perfect balance. The salmon fillet was cooked to just the right temperature, not dry and not \"rare\". Excellent flavor with carmelized onions on top and with a side of sweet potatoes and grilled asparagus in lemon butter. Mmm-mmm again.\n\nThe portions were just right for the entrees. They had some excellent looking desserts that the waiter displayed for us on a plate. However, we were happily filled and sipping our wine while enjoying the music. We were sitting one table away from the band, and the volume was just right; able to hold a conversation without yelling.\n\nOverall, had a wonderful meal. Only minimal complaint would be the prices. They were slightly a little bit on the high side. Not sure if business is taking a hit, but the prices on the menu for the entrees on the website are not accurate. Currently, the prices for the entrees are two dollars more than advertised. The chicken entrée was $20. The small plates are still the same advertised price online.\n\nEnjoy the tunes and food, keep this place going and perhaps get the prices done. Cheers!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Aqua blue hits your eyes when you first step in. A cozy bar stretches from the entrance to the back of the kitchen on the right side. The restaurant itself is packed with tiny little tables and a small stage in the back for the Jazz musicians to play. \n\nWhen we arrived it was ABSOLUTELY EMPTY! Now....this may be a good or a bad thing - it depends on what kind of night you are looking for ;) It had been a Wednesday evening in November and it was pouring rain out. However.... I don't think there's anything better than sitting in an empty room with candles all lit up with a personal live Jazz performance as background music. Well maybe not background music since the singing was a bit loud and overpowered our conversation at times. Were they just vying for our attention? :) After their performances, the musicians\/owners (amnesia on names) were friendly enough to chat with us, making it a little less awkward since we were the only 2 in the room - and also letting us know they weren't just going to eavesdrop on our conversation the entire time. Later on in the night, the power went out! Everything went dark - which I think made the restaurant 100 times more romantic because of all the candles....and also wasn't blinded by the hideous blue paint on the walls!\n\nDespite my positive review, I would only give this place 3 stars from a food\/drink standpoint but giving it a 4 because of the atmosphere and live Jazz performance :)\n\nAppetizer: Apple pancake w\/ Salmon\nEntree: Airline Chicken w\/ Spinach and Sweet Potato Mash\nDrink: Basil Vodka\nAll yummy.\n\nOverall, a great place to take your date for great Live Jazz (the smoky kind) and special alone-time....","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Some don't pay attention to customers and others are just plain creepy. One of the workers are so creepy I refuse to go in the store when they work. The owner used to be really great, but she's kind of teetered off. I don't really know how to describe the change. It's like she's checked out. The one great thing about her is that she really is helpful to any customers who don't know much about games. I wish the rest of the workers were the same.\n\nIf you're just looking for a place to play games, Peg is great. If you're looking to buy stuff there, the prices and creep level just isn't worth it.","useful":3,"funny":5,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

That's it, this is by far some of the best Chinese food I have had in Arizona.  If that does not get you motivated wait till you see the prices....\n\nThe lunch specials are priced at $4.55 for a combo plate and $5.55 for the shrimp combo plates. With 20 different combos I am sure you will find something you like.  A soda will set you back $1.25 or go for 1 can of soda for .85 cents.  Hot tea and water was my choice.\n\nThe Restaurant just opened last month so it still needs some work....Some empty fish tanks, needs some ceiling pieces replaced, but it really is a great place for authentic fast food Chinese.  I wish this place was closer to my home since they offer delivery. Yes you have to spend over $12.00 for delivery, but that would be easy for dinner or an office ordering lunch.\n\nIf you are craving dinner and are on a budget you can still eat here.  Not one plate on the menu is over $8.00!  I think I ordered enough to feed a family 2 nights in a row, plus lunch for work and for about $30. \n\nOK so if price does not entice you the fresh food and delicious entrees will.  We ordered several different dishes and I cannot complain about any of them.  We loved the lo mein, beef egg foo young, Mongolian beef, fried rice, and cashew shrimp.  They gave us plenty of crab puffs for free as well plus a large container of white rice.  I generally am not a fan of the crab puffs, but the cream cheese was fresh and the fried puff seemed to be light and crispy.  \n\nIf you are on a diet or really watching your calorie intake they even have lo cal entrees on the menu, not the norm at a Chinese Restaurant.  Chicken, shrimp, or a vegetable plate for you serious calorie number watchers.\n\nMy family and I all loved the food here.  I hope you will give them an opportunity to earn your business.  The price for food is excellent and what shocked me more is the food is excellent.  Based on Max's review I gave it a shot and now my whole family is thanking me for a new found place to eat.

With it, I ordered the greens, yams, hush puppies, and macaroni & cheese.  Big Mama must've not been there, because she probably wouldn't have approved of the quality of the food put out that day.  The greens, yams, and macaroni & cheese were decent, the hush puppies were too salty, and the fried chicken was pretty tasty.  But the place is called \"Big Mama's Rib Shack\", not Big Mama's Chicken House.  The ribs were such a disappointment!  Not only were they teeth-ripping tough, they were obviously at least a day old and reheated (not very well).  My ribs were, at most, a warm 85 degrees...I'm sure the health department wouldn't approve.  \n\nThe fried chicken was actually very good, but does that warrant an extra star?

They were working so fast that they didn't notice that the pieces coming out of some of the boxes were a different wood (which has since sarted to crack). When we noticed the discrepancy, they had to call boss Kevin to come over and he had no interest in making it right. He made us feel like overly demanding customers who don't  understand the product.

The workers were all super nice, polite (even during my radical request to change their perfect-just-the-way-it-is food), and they legimately seemed like they were enjoying themselves which i think makes for a great atmosphere :)\n\nThe only thing I'd like to see different is the option to have your tots unsalted.  I'm not a fan of salt (or the bloating that comes with it) so even though the tots were only lightly salted and it didn't affect the flavor negatively, i'd still like to see the option to get them without.   \n\nOverall,  I've tried a few other trucks now (that i will be reviewing one by one in my spare time) and i have to say that The Nosh Box is definitely my favorite Cleveland area food truck!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Actually I don't get food from food trucks too often... not a fan of the lines, somewhat higher prices and hanging around outside if it's hot.  But I figured I would give this one a try; and I must say it has kinda changed my mind about all the reasons I didn't go to food trucks previously.\n\nI purchased the vegetable wrap and some fries.  Usually a veggie wrap isn't enough to fill me up, hence the fries.  So when my order was complete and I was handed both, I was quite surprised at just how MUCH food I was given.  Could I eat all this?  I sat down and worked on that issue.\n\nCalling this thing a wrap perhaps do it justice.  It's actuall a huge, thick and grilled flatbread topped with yummy hummus, massive grilled vegetable chunks, and perhaps another sauce I can't quite remember.  I just remember the delicious journey involved as I ate this (relatively) healthy beast of a wrap.  \n\nThe only problem I encountered with my meal was not knowing what I liked better; the fries or the wrap.  I finished both fries and wrap, and loved whatever seasoning\/oil the fries were cooked in.  All in all, the best veggie wrap I've ever had in addition to some darn good fries.\n\nOverall kinda pricey... overall for a lunch, $7 for the wrap and $3 for the fries.  So not something I'd get every day... plus, I doubt it's all around great health food.  But hope this food truck comes to my job more often, and I'll perhaps be inspired to not pack lunch as much.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Could this be because I was referred to him as someone who would do a bilateral procedure on my spine and not tow unilateral procedures but the referring doctor is upset because I complained here was NO MEDICAL NECESSITY for 2 procedure and it was to collect more money from the insurance company?\n\nDr. Harris started out pretty icy and asked \"So why are you here?\"  You could tell he already had an opinion of some sort.  I explained that I first went to Nevada Orthopaedic and spine where I had appointment after appointment, found multiple over-billings and never even got to a diagnosis so then I was referred by my doc to Innovative Pain who told me they were in network with Blue Cross but were not AND Dr. Wu told me there was no medical reason to have 2 procedures and I had to talk to the office manager where I found out it was so they got paid more.... and they referred me to you and I called in advance to verify that you can bill correctly and will do both sides of my messed up spine in one procedure.  (double time off work, double medical transportation costs, double recovery, double possibility of side effects from sedation, double the chance of infection..who wants that?)\n\nI haven't asked for drugs or narcotics and am trying to avoid them with a procedure that takes 60 minutes (according to Dr. Harris but Dr. Wu told me 30-40) but according to doc Harris 60 minute is too much time but he would do  two 30 minute procedures.  His explanation was they did a lot of procedures and were busy.   \n\nApparently they don't study math in med school.   30+30= 60.... and you eliminate one prep and sedation period so it would actually take LESS time!\n\nDr. Harris's cold and compassionless 5 minutes told me all I need to know.  He shouldn't be practicing medicine.  Everyone in the lobby was talking about their meds and getting Lortab refills etc...   So apparently this is not a doctors office but a drug dispensary.\n\nIf you want something other than drugs and a huge medical bill ... Good luck!\n\nIf you have experienced billing before medicine, make sure you report it to your insurance company (I'm self insured so I watch every penny!) AND the state board of medical examiners.  Doctors are REQUIRED to make the best medical decision, not the best decision for their pocket book.... although in this case since the story change between the time I talked on the phone and he time I got there, I have little doubt Dr. Wu and Dr. Harris decided to circle the wagons and make it impossible for me to ever receive he care I need.\n\nBut hell, they will whip out that scrip pad in a hot second so WTF?","useful":4,"funny":2,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Because of illness I have not been able to work with Diane but she was one of my motivating factors in completing  a half marathon this past July.\n\nI would definitely recommend both TRX training and personal training with Body by Diane.

Here is the saga... I have been through 3 different pool companies before we started doing it ourselves... and then failed at it. I fired the other pool companies because they didn't show up let my pool turn green, demanded that I get a pool robot, took my filter apart then said they couldn't put it back together and left it like that, constantly tried to sell me more and more products and services to fix my algae problem, dumped a whole bag of soda ash in my pool, used my own pool chemicals instead of providing their own, left garbage all around my yard, and various other problems. I decided to find a pool company that knew how to treat customers and actually cares about their work.\n\nAdmittedly, I have an older \"problem\" pool that is in need of new plaster, and it has older equipment. It turns out that my pool developed cracks and divits when the pool was empty when it was a foreclosure. The newly formed cracks made it end up getting a black algae problem, and no matter how much chlorine, scrubbing, and metal brushing, and chemicals - the thing turned green within a week during the summer months, even with regular pool service from multiple different companies over the years. I got new water twice, did chlorine baths, did every treatment that the pool store suggested, scrubbed it with a wire brush manually while in the pool with goggles on, and still never could swim in my pool comfortably all the time in the summer. It would always turn green within less than a week. And even with multiple chlorine floaters in it, new filters, a chlorine bath, proper chemical levels, the thing still turned green.\n\nWhen I hired Summer Pools, I explained them all of my hassles before, and they decided to take my problem pool on, with the explanation that they would try to get me through the summer, but would not make any promises. They used a special algae solution to combat my issues, came weekly on schedule, texted me to put away the dogs every time, and actually got me through the summer without issues of any kind. ALL SUMMER LONG.. This was a miracle. \n\nTheir prices are on par with what we paid every other company, the difference is that Steven is actually a human that cares about his work, has integrity, has good customer service, and he does what he says he is going to do.  \n\nSteven is awesome all the way around, I can't say anything negative about him at all. He cleans \"Robby the robot\" when he gets palm trees stuck in him, and best thing is we were actually problem free all summer and were able to use the pool at will, anytime we wanted.. ALL SUMMER LONG! \n\nIf you have a problem pool, or just have received bad service in the past, I would suggest trying these guys out. Seriously. \n\nFYI - I do plan to fix my pool and get it plastered when I can save up the $7k to get new tile and plaster. Then all of my issues will be gone forever.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

I've been here a handful of times, and each time I've had an issue arise.\n\nMy first visit occurred within 15 minutes of closing.  The staff told me they had run out of bread.

By their very nature banks tend to suck... But, not so with Wells Fargo and especially this mini-branch inside a Safeway Supermarket. I have had my personal accounts there since 2007, but what really made me appreciate this branch was when I started doing business banking there. First, I opened a business checking account for the advertising payments I started receiving from Google for a couple of my blogs. Then, when we grew the business and incorporated as Automotive Media Partners, LLC I went to this branch to meet with them. The business banking manager walked me through various options for setting up our new company accounts, handled everything very professionally and provided a level of service that exceeds what I have come to expect from banks. He set up accounts for AR, AP and Equity. The Wells Fargo banker set up my Merchant Services account so we could take credit card payments... At a discount rate of 2% and 2.25% for Amex (very low cost). Then he went on to approve a line of credit for the company that far exceeded what I expected.  AMP has exceeded our revenue forecasts for 2012 and I am appreciative enough for Wells Fargo and the way this branch treats me an my company to be fiercely loyal. My investors have tried to get me to move accounts to B of A and I have insisted that we keep our growing business accounts with Wells Fargo and this branch.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

We were actually considering replacing all of our carpeting. I called and spoke to Russell to get his thoughts on the matter. After a short conversation, I was convinced that he would handle our problem. He also guaranteed his work which is hard to find these days.  \n\nRussell scheduled an appointment with us just a couple days away from our initial call and he showed up on time and he did a great job. He is a very nice guy and very professional.  \n\nA day after the cleaning, we noticed two areas that seamed a bit sticky or like there was some sort of residue on the carpet.  I called Russell and he said give it another day to make sure it was completely dry and to call back if they didn't get better. These two areas were treated heavily due to dog urine. Another couple of days went by and we got busy with day to day stuff. Out of the blue, Russell called to check up on our carpets. I checked the areas and they  were still \"sticky\". He came out the following morning, right on time and recleaned those areas.  \n\nWe will definitely use Russell and Integrity again. We have given his number out to many friends and family members.  Lastly, his prices are very very good, much lower than anyone we've used in the past. \n\nThanks again Russell!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

What we witnessed is  group of people finished eating got up from the table left dirty plates and napkins on the table 2 minute later different party comes in and without hesitation they put there sandwiches on the dirty table and started enjoying the food .,then one of the guys who was cooking the kebabs comes picks up all the dirty trays from the top of the garbage can and  without cleaning them he puts it next to the barbeque area and uses the same tray for next order . We were very surprised that not even 1 person complaining about this disgusting dirty restaurant until we started observing the kind of people were coming in , Curious?

There are too many things that makes the atmosphere uncomfortable to a certain extent.  \n\nThere was a female bartender who stood 10 feet away from me.

Best version of this flavor I've ever had!! Wish I'd gotten more...perfect ratio of chocolate chips to cake & yummy icing!

Kind of like a poppyseed muffin with fruity bits\/jam. \n\n-maple bacon: no hesitation to buy this one at all bc this is a hard flavor to find & one I absolutely love!! Their cupcake in this flavor was good, not the best.\n\n-cookies & cream: DH loved this one! has a nice filling.\n\n-peanut butter chocolate: amazing!!! \n\n\nWe also had salted caramel (got a bit of icing on my hand by accident & didn't like it much as I found it too salty), butterscotch, chocolate raspberry, lemon, coconut, plain chocolate, plain vanilla,  Guinness chocolate & German chocolate in our boxes. \n\nThe minis were the perfect bite (and I don't feel too guilty having 2 lol)....overall, this shop has cupcakes that are moist,  not overly sweet, exciting flavors,  good ratio of fillings\/icing to cake & I  totally recommend","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

It sounds like a horrible cliche but  I felt like they really were honest, caring dentists.\n\nIf you are all about going to a place with all the high tech equipment - this may not be for you(I went to one on Bay - and all my fillings also fell out- the equipment couldn't help a bad dentist); but if you want your visit to be pleasant and want to go to a dental office that genuinely care about your oral health - though they may not have the best equipment - this is definitely recommended.\n\nANOTHER MAJOR PLUS POINT: THEY ARE OPEN 7 DAYS A WEEK!!!!! :)","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Eher schon, Wild zu essen. Das mag Hans Hummel nämlich nicht, und das kocht er nicht. Oder Gurkensalat - nie und nimmer. Auch mit den Nachspeisen hat er es nicht so, \"des kann i net\", sagt er.

I happened upon here today for lunch and can't believe in all the years I've been hangin in the s. side I never stopped prior.  The space itself is very nice it has exposed brick a nice bar with plenty of seating and multiple booths with dark wood and leather all around.  The only one complaint that I have about my initial impression is that it did  smell a little bit like my basement used to smell after a keg party in college when I first walked in.  I was greeted warmly by one of the servers \"Li Li\" I believe.  She was very friendly and we chatted for a while.  The bartender was \"Bear\".  He was a good typical burgh' bartender.  He served me a guiness quickly and knew the point spreads for all the college and pro games.  I ordered the \"ultimate burger\" which I ordered medium and they let me substitute a cup of french onion soup instead of getting fries.  Incidentally, they were very amenable to all kinds of sub stitutions as I witnessed while others ordered at the bar.  The soup was forgettable.  The broth itself was tasty enough and well seasoned, but the cheese wasn't burnt, it looked like they skipped putting it under the broiler.  It really doesn't matter the burger was the main feature.  Incidentally, I had no idea that this place was known for burgers, so it looks like I lucked out with the order.  The burger arrived quick enough it was a big 8 oz. burger overflowing with brie.  The burger was served on a perfectly toasted warm italian roll.  The burger itself was cooked perfectly and had great flavor.  I'm pretty sure this meat is ground fresh daily and never frozen.  It very much reminded me of a Tessaros burger (and quite frankly maybe it was just as good, but I can't bring myself to say it).  The staff was so friendly I found myself staying for 3 guiness instead of a typical 1 beer lunch portion.  I will go again and stick to the burgers.  The rest of the menu was very reasonably priced, but again I think the burger is the star.  Incidentally, I was speaking with a friend in the restaurant business after lunch and the guy who originally opened tessaros is the current owner of city grill, so that accounts for much of the similiarity.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

I've been a huge fan of Charlie Trotter's in Chicago, and was excited to try out his new place in Las Vegas emphasizing seafood. Maybe it was because it was so late (9:30pm on a Friday night after a show) but the servers were definitely not on their game. Though they advertise that they take reservations until 11:00pm, there was just one other party in the restaurant.\n\nI started out with a nice, albeit expensive glass of Schramsberg, and was greeted by a refreshing amuse consisting of a little pile of Peekytoe crab seasoned with light citrus and vinegar flavors. As an aside, I wonder what the attraction of Peekytoe crab is...it seems that it is always somewhat tough and stringy. I much prefer Maryland Blue Crab. \n\nI started out with a Fruits de Mer with spot prawns, cockles, and oysters. The presentation was lovely but it was oversalted. Furthermore, though chilled, I didn't realize that the spot prawns would be raw...they weren't even cured by the citrus, and as a result, were unpleasantly mushy with a lingering aftertaste. The dish was garnished with two deep-fried shrimp heads, but these were lukewarm and tasted like they had been done well in advance of plating. \n\nMy wife had spiced artichokes with honey and pine nuts. Now these were delicious. The artichokes were deep-fried and seasoned with some Moroccan-inspired heat. Great dish.\n\nI proceeded to have the Lobster tart with chorizo and trumpet mushrooms. This was again marred by oversalting and the generous chunks of lobster were a bit overdone. Conceptually, the problem I have with this dish is that there was an overwhelming amount of chorizo that had been overcooked resulting in a vinaigrette with lots of \"pebbles\". \n\nFinally, I had the hamachi with braised short ribs and trumpet mushrooms. It was okay. The short ribs tasted a little on the tough and stringy side, and again seemed oversalted to me (I wonder if they had been sitting around too long out of their braising liquid through the course of the day). The fish, though nice and rare in the middle, seems to have been seared at too high a temperature so that the exterior was overdone...I've never encoutered that before!\n\nIn the meantime, my wife had the ocean trout with oysters and hijiki. The oysters were perfectly poached and remained meltingly tender albeit too salty, but the trout again tasted overdone and chewy. \n\nWe would have given a pass on the food if the service were better. It was very friendly and as a result, it was very difficult to post a negative review. But it seemed unattentive. We had a dining companion who was vegetarian but did not like beets. We made this clear to the many servers which attended us. So the amuse came with roasted beets. We pointed this out to the server. Then her next dish came with beets. We again had to point this out.\n\nAgain, this dining experience was so disappointing in view of the fact that I love Charlie Trotter's so much. For my wife's two courses and my three courses, a glass of Schramsberg and a glass of chablis, tax and tip, we paid nearly $300 (way overpriced). The place did have the air of a place doomed to impending failure wafting about.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

I was completely unprepared for her passing, she had just turned 30 and was full of life. Whether I was prepared or not, funeral arrangements needed to be made right away.\n\nI went to several funeral homes to find the one that really just had the right feel. The right feel for me was a combination of the people that would be assisting and helping us and atmosphere of the place inside and out.  I didn't want some dumpy looking place that I was further depressed stepping into.\n\nI was impressed with the people that ran the funeral home.  They were professional and compassionate.  Sympathetic without being phoney.  I didn't feel like it was all about the money or that I was dealing with snakes.  Everyone was very nice and helpful.  The woman that held our services was great.\n\nThey offered options and choices for additional costs but were not tacky in their approach of presenting the different options.  They have a full showroom in the back, where you can choose a casket and all of the little things that you don't really think of, like sign in books or even having your loved ones fingerprint put onto a necklace.  I purchased my casket online from a company that delivered overnight and didn't charge any shipping costs (the cost is like $1,000.00 - $2,000.00 less if you do this -for the same casket), but it is nice that they had the caskets available and ready at their location.  I couldn't bring myself to buy the fingerprint necklace (it felt a little morbid but I wish I would have gotten it now) but I did get a sign in book and some other things that I needed and it was nice to know everything was on hand.  They also were able to provide everything for the service and there are lots of little things.  It's like planning a wedding to a certain extent, there is always something else you need to have that you didn't think of.\n\nThe facilities are really nice inside and out.  The building is very well maintained and the landscaping is nicely groomed.  Everything was very clean.  They have two viewing rooms, one is larger and one is a little bit smaller and more intimate.  Both viewing rooms were very well maintained and comfortable.  I choose the smaller, more intimate space and was very happy with it.\n\nI was also happy with the understanding that they had for my requests.  I was able to go in and see my sister's body before anyone else and before the day of the viewing.  They allowed me to come into the funeral home on the day of the viewing several hours before the viewing began and spend four or five hours getting her hair and makeup right - by myself without anyone interrupting me (I'm really happy they let me do this because when my mom finally had to see her at the viewing, she looked more like herself but like she was just sleeping).  They also gave me the option of being present when they dressed her as I was uncomfortable with anyone handling her body - but in the end, I let them dress her as I felt comfortable with their professionalism and I needed to go home and shower and dress for her ceremony.  All in all, they were very nice and understanding.\n\nI recommend nobody you love ever passing away but if it happens and you need to find a funeral home, this is a really nice place with top notch people running it.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Das Mobiliar der Aussenterrasse lässt dagegen z.T. sehr zu wünschen übrig (ein Tisch mit zerbrochener Tischplatte). - Im Gastraum bestellten wir gratinierte Artischoken und Miesmuscheln in Weißweinsoße mit warmem Brot (je 7.--) - letztere wurden in großer Pfanne serviert und wurden von meiner Begleitung außerordentlich gelobt, aber auch ich war zufrieden und von der Portion so satt, daß ich mir für die folgenden Tagliolini mit Blattspinat und Garnelen von der Wochenkarte (9.--) ein \"doggy bag\" packen lassen musste, weil ich damit schlicht überfordert war. Die bestellten Spaghetti Bolognese (6,50) schmeckten zwar, nur leider wurde kein Reibekäse dazu angeboten - trotzdem wurde auch meine Begleitung pappsatt. Unser Tipp: wer unsere Vorspeisen testen möchte, sollte ohne \"Bärenhunger\" dazu nur noch ein Dessert bestellen (z.B. Tiramisu 3,20). Aber auch die am Nachbartisch servierten Pizzen sahen sehr einladend aus. \n- Unser Gesamteindruck: ein sympathisches, fast schon intimes Lokal mit empfehlenswertem Preis-\/Leistungsverhältnis, das wir sicher wieder testen mögen. - DI bis SO bis 22 Uhr geöffnet.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

This place is an adventure for your sweet tooth.   If you are a fan of European pastry & 'biscuits' (a.k.a. Cookies), then this place will fill you with the familiar smells, taste, as well as satisfying your sweet craving.\n\nThe offerings change but there are always some constants.  Didem takes pride in her creations and it most certainly shows in her enthusiasm as well as patience in explaining the various goodies to you. She will even let you taste various cookies before you can settle your mind. If you are like me and you can't make up your mind between the choices, just get a couple of each - trust me you will not regret.  In here quality does NOT diminish with quantity.  \n\nDuring my last visit, I had the Sesame seed savories ( these go perfectly with a cup of Earl Grey tea) , 3 different flavors of ( colored to match the flavor ) cream cookies, and Almond-Hazlenut Cookies ( come in a pack of two ).  None of these tasted like the dry crunchy cookies otherwise found in chain stores. They are a perfect combination of flakiness on the outside with just the right consistency of softness inside.  One bite and I bet you won't be able to put it down.  I could feel my sweet tooth giving a sigh of utter satisfaction.  Didem will even entertain any special order request you might have.  She was very willing to consider and deliver upon one my special orders of Half Moon cookies.\n\nThere are plenty of variety I need to try ( some familiar and some that I'm sure will be delicious ) as I look forward to my next visit.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

She went back and found 2 she liked. The salesman explained that they could finish off the edges and that the order would be completed fairly quickly. He advised her that their orders come back on Mondays and Thursdays and that the person who finishes the customization on their carpets would be in shortly...so her order could go out that day. Sure enough, about 10 minutes later, someone appeared bringing in pieces of carpeting that had been custom ordered. She placed her order and it went out that day. Price points were very reasonable and the salesman was efficient and friendly.\n\nWhile she was looking at throw carpet\/area rugs, the salesman offered more help and explained where each carpet was made (most were in Iran) and the variations in prices.

I went from \"how can I finagle my way out of this,\" to \"how can I get ON a jury.\" The difference? My unemployment benefits are long gone. I NEED the money. Even if it's only $40 a day. \n\nThanks to my low number, I was among the first 45 potential jurors herded into line. I was included in the first 23, designated the \"panel.\" That means I was one of the prime candidates. The additional 22 are drafted to assure a sufficient number to round out a jury after the grueling \"voir dire\" phase, the process by which jurors with potential biases are identified and excused.\n\nFrom the getgo, the case was explained as open-and-shut, likely to last only two days. Hey, 80 bucks! Enough to pay a utility bill or at the very least a little beer money. I kept quiet throughout the questioning. Prospective jurors are invited to relate their experiences about past encounters with law enforcement and the justice system. Had I any qualms about my ability to be impartial, I would have spoken up. I was under oath, after all. I decided hell no, I can be impartial. \n\nFor those wishing to escape jury duty, here is your chance. Just make an issue about any voir dire topic and you will likely be excused. It doesn't mean you are not worthy. From a pool of 45, 13 are selected based on their answers during voir dire. Getting excused from one panel doesn't necessarily get you off the hook, however. You must report back to Jury Services for possible reassignment.\n\nAfter the jury was empaneled (I was #12), a young woman protested that she had a job interview the following morning. \"Why didn't you say something?\" the judge asked. \"I didn't think I would be excused,\" she said. She needs a life coach. You are given every chance to state your reasons for not serving. The flimsiest excuse might be honored. If the judge and the attorneys agree, boom, you're gone. After the trial, the kindly judge (The Honorable Douglas W. Herndon) went so far as to apologize to the young lass. He told her he would gladly speak to the recruiter. \n\nUp to five days before your reporting date, you can call the automated system and reschedule.\n\nWhereas my first experience was painless, this time was a horror show. A thousand prospective jurors were called. The jury corral was crammed beyond capacity, with as many as 100 draftees having to stand outside until seating came available. Meanwhile, those inside the corral had to suffer in stifling heat, struggling for a breath of fresh air. Those with body odor issues made matters worse.\n\nJudge Herndon later explained that the throng of 1000 included 250 for one murder trial alone. The scene at the Fremont Street parking garage was another fright. The line to get in wound around two blocks. It took me 20 minutes to get in. Toward the front subhumans tried to barge in. Some fools actually let 'em. I say don't give these lowlifes an inch. What makes people like this feel entitled to cut in front and not wait like all the other chumps? One juror paid $20 at another garage rather than fight the mob.\n\nThe line waiting to get into the courthouse wound out the door and down the block. Another lengthy wait in the chilly wind. \n\nOnce inside, the gathering was subjected to a tiresome movie featuring the reprehensible and revolting husband-and-wife news team known as the Wagners. They managed to mangle the legal term \"peremptory,\" an inexcusable gaffe.\n\nAt first I was annoyed with the jury clerks screaming over the PA system. They acted toward the group as if they were military recruits or prison inductees. There's way too much yelling. The marshall who took our group to the 16th floor tried his hand at a drill sergeant impersonation. What a jerk, I thought. Later he calmed down and turned out to be nice enough. I came to realize the jury wranglers coped pretty well with conditions that made everyone miserable. \n\nThe brief trial was monotonous and repetitive. I found myself zoning out a couple of times but I quickly snapped out of it. You have to pay attention. This is serious business. \n\nThe case was air-tight. While the rest of us sat wondering what to do, a young woman brilliantly summarized the case in about three sentences. Another woman suggested a vote by raising hands. Guilty. Without two leaders who seized the initiative, it might have taken us a while longer to get our act together.\n\nAfter the trial, Judge Herndon visited with the jury for a brief informal chat. He's very impressive. As a fellow juror said, \"Now we know who to vote for next time.\"\n\nWe also had a chance to speak to the prosecutor. Dazed by the whole trial experience, I didn't have my wits about me. Later, I realized I should have asked him to thank Crystal Z., the heroic woman who confronted the drunk driver.

So between unreturned phone calls and a poor website, I was climbing uphill to rent here.

The menu for our dinner was chef's choice, which featured dishes which were prepared with produce from the owner's own garden from what I was told. The food here was absolutely delicious and I couldn't believe it was only fifteen bucks!\n\nA few of my favorite and more memorable items were the Falafel and Early Summer Stew. I really didn't evaluate the service during this meal because it was served family style and the drinks were self-serve. I enjoyed the good conversational buzz punctuated with plenty of 'yums'.\n\nThis Meetup group meets once a month at this restaurant and is limited to 20 people.

I wasn't once asked anything about what needed attention, massage-wise. She just went at it. In addition, my package included a half-hour facial, and she never asked a thing about my skin -- sensitivies, likes\/dislikes. Nothing. I'm quite sure I got a fancy application of massage oil for the massage part, and a pre-set , rather cursory routine of basic cleaning, exfoliation and mask for the facial.\n\nDuring the facial procedure, she consistently dropped towels (that she was using for her hands) on my feet as I lay under the drapings. Over and over again.\n\nThe one thing I quite liked was the heated bean bag that she put on the back of my neck. Until she kept moving it by dropping it from place to place on the massage table, to get it out of the way so she could work on an area.

The massages by her staff though were not that professional and was pretty disappointing. First one of the masseuse started giggling during the massage, not exactly want you want to hear when you're lying face down on a bed, practically naked. My boyfriend commeted afterwards that it made him a little self concious. Second most of the massage was spent rubbing in oil. Both masseuses used up most of the time just rubbing body parts rather than giving the sorely needed deep massaging both our bodies needed. Thankfully our second visit was a voucher deal, if we were paying over a hundred dollars for those \"massages\" then we would've been more disappointed and complained.\nSo based on the so-so massages my boyfrend and I got I would only give two stars, hence the three star rating.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

We just ordered potstickers, but as we peered back into the kitchen we could see Pat hand crafting egg rolls, which led us to believe the potstickers were also homemade. \n\nAfter we placed our order, Pat appeared from the kitchen filled with stories, the first of which was an explanation as to how he was an old man set in his ways and therefore it would take time for our potstickers because he had to prepare them the proper way. Subsequent stories included an explanation of his patriotic wear (he served in the Korean War); how he raised a bushel of children (punishing them all when just one did wrong), and how he had been asked by Ronald Reagan to serve in the SBA and used to serve Oscar Goodman noodles when he was a poor attorney.\n\nI think it's easy to say that Pat is an iconic Las Vegan, and at least once in your time here, you should pull up a seat to his counter and have a snack.

I loved it! \n\nThe service was friendly, the price was right ($4 for the lunch special), and the food was delicious. It's basically scalloped potatoes (which I haven't actually seen very often in Toronto, except at some pubs) covered in nacho toppings--there's a lot of options to choose from and a few are pretty creative. I went with one of the simpler options with chili and melted cheese. It was delicious! The ingredients were nice and fresh, there was plenty of cheese and it was completely melted (that's important). The potatoes themselves were also great; not too salty but not bland at all, not too crispy but also not too soggy--just right. You have to eat them with a fork unless you really like getting messy--either way, it's delicious. \n\nI plan on returning and trying out some of the other options. If I went to Ryerson I'd probably go here for lunch a lot since the price is right. It also might be a good option for drunk food since they're open pretty late.

I got the Pachula Veggie Deluxe at $7.95 and all but two of my other coworkers followed suit. The other two just got the daily lunch special which was around $4.50.\n\nOverall, interesting concept for a food place. It's not quite scalloped potatoes like others have said; scalloped potatoes are potatoes cooked in milk\/cream with cheese and butter and browned under a salamander or broiler. They're incredibly decadent and rich. Irish Potato Nahcos is basically sliced potatoes with toppings. I was a bit disappointed because I was expecting more of a gooey cheesy yummy mess to be on top of my potatoes and THEN toppings, but it was good nonetheless. \n\nMy main complaint (and my coworkers agreed) was that the portion sizing wasn't really that good for what we paid. With a drink, my \"meal\" cost $10.50 and I'm barely full now; I'm sure I'll be hungry again in an hour or two. This place is generous with the toppings but not so much with the potatoes, which aren't exactly that expensive to begin with. We all finished wishing there was more in our containers.\n\nIf I were to go back (which we probably will for snacks at some point) I would go with the smaller lunch special version. its' definitely not enough for a meal, but it looked WAY more appetizing than the \"meal\" I got and it was only about $4.50 with tax. But I doubt I'll be going back here anytime soon unless one of my coworkers wants a repeat. I'll be more likely to take my $10 somewhere else and get a whole lot more food and have change leftover for dessert.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Brand new clean Toyota Aygo, £20 of petrol in the car on pickup to be returned with an empty tank, no problems upon returning the vehicle. \n\nThere was, however, one major flaw with Easirent Edinburgh Airport.\n\nAfter making a booking in advance for ten days car hire of a small vehicle, I thoroughly read the terms and conditions which stated that a £500 deposit would be held on my partner's credit card (the name on the booking). However, when I arrived at the Easirent office to collect the car, we were informed that the actual deposit was £1250, considerably more than what was stated in the contract. We could reduce this by paying a surcharge of approximately £15 a day, which added up quickly for a ten day lease. This charge was non-refundable. If I had known this in advance we could have made sure that £1250 was available on the card. Due to it being 9pm we had no way to clear the funds on our card so were left to pay the £150 charge.\n\nWhat surprised me the most was the friendly sales assistant who told us about this excess. He said that this happens on a regular basis, customers expecting a £500 hold and finding out when they pick up the car that it is actually far dearer. After reading reviews online for other Easirent offices around the UK I know that I am certainly not the only one to experience this. This could easily be resolved by stating these terms clearly in the contract in the first instance. This particular sales assistant mentioned that he has tried calling and emailing the head office about this several times but has yet to receive a response.\n\nThis seems like a shameless way to make customers pay an extra charge. The fact that Easirent have been made aware of this, yet refuses to act on it, is simply beyond me. It seems like a sure-fire way to lose out on customers returning or recommending to friends and family, which will most certainly be the case for me.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

I'd been going to my previous auto shop for years. I used to have to call them the afternoon after I dropped off to ask what was wrong with my car. Then I'd have to wait at least another day, maybe two or more, for them to fix it. I had to rush to get there before 5:30. It was dirty there but hey my car got fixed properly. I didn't actually think you could find a place that would do better, but there is! \n\nI've been going to see Tony and Johnny at Oasis Service Center for several years. Their service is friendly, prompt, and reliable. I've unfortunately spent thousands of dollars with them over the last few years but my car runs great. \n\nHere's why you should go. \n\nThey actually call you within a couple of hours or so to give you the run down. You don't have to let that pool of sweat about what is wrong or what it's going to cost gather too long. They'll actually let you know. \n\nThey will not charge you or encourage you to service items you do not need. They fixed my friend's door for free when she was there for another service. On a recent trip for a break job, they identified a noise coming from what I'd call the appendix of my axle. A rubber piece had broken free and was flopping around making noise. They cut it off for free. He told me not to replace the axle just for that, it isn't vital (like our appendix, get the reference now?). If it vibrates at high speeds, then replace it. How cool is that? He could have told me to replace the axle for that but didn't. \n\nThe prices are reasonable, and my estimate is always accurate. Fair market value for qualified, certified technicians. It does make a difference. Your mom's friend may be able to fix your car, but doubtful he'll do it properly. Trust me on this, you don't want some yahoo digging in to the car just to save a few measly bucks. Don't be such a tightwad, it won't save you in the long run, get y our ride fixed right. \n\nYou don't have to kill yourself to get to them before closing. They have a gas station just one mile away that is open later (til 11 pm I think) that they'll drop off your keys to so you can pick up your car after hours if you ask. You will need to pay with a credit card over the phone for your services in that case, but hey, it makes it easy to drop and pick up! \n\nThey're open Saturdays! I believe they close a little earlier but I've never had a problem getting a repair done on Saturday to avoid the whole figuring out a ride to work thing. \n\nThey're in a bigger location now, and have moved the service department to a spot by the Fry's on Guadalupe and McClintock.

I will not go into detail about that since it has been written about extensively by other yelpers. I will focus on the main dish itself. The succulent Katsu. Most poorly done Katsu are over-fried, dried or under \/ over-battered. The Katsu here was just perfect. Fried just right to be crispy but not dry, with the juices of the pork still intact. Not over or under-battered, battered just right and cooked just right (over-dry and still runny batter are the worst). You can taste the pork through the fried batter. The fried batter does not overtake the taste. Secondly, the sauce. The sauce accentuates the Katsu just right. In short, all elements of the dish compliments each other without overriding each other.

On the other hand, I went one time at 4AM and there was no crowd!  However, during after work or early morning sometimes it's just too busy.\n\nPerhaps if they reorganized the place so that, for example, the two bicep curl machines were side by side instead of upstairs and downstairs it might help alleviate the congestion.\n\nI used to belong to ClubOne on North Service road.  ClubOne is more expensive than GoodLife, but like they say, you get what you pay for.\n\nI go to two GoodLife locations.  This one is walkable, the other one I need to drive to get there.   All things being equal, I'll go to the other location when I have the chance.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The inside of the store is really beautiful and well-maintained, and they are very selective about the items that they want to consign.\n\nThe owner is great. I went in a few months after dropping off some clothing, and she remembered me. Always a great feeling.

I would suggest going in early enough so that people can take a look.\n\nI was looking for a place that would really take care of these clothing items, and I'm happy to say that ECB was the place!

Everyone I met in this city was nice and friendly, except for the worker (I believe it was the owner, Kalid?) I spoke with. We were looking for a shirt and the man spoke down to us the entire time, attempting to make us feel like idiots. He was unhelpful when we asked for it, and acted like a jerk from the moment we walked in. When he made a condescending remark about the clothes we were looking at we confronted him about being so rude and ended up walking out of the store because of how disrespectful he was being to us. All we did was ask him for some help finding a certain shirt and got nothing but discourtesy. Avoid this store at all costs.

And they honor their credits; my mother returned a pricey Habs shirt nearly a year ago and they honored it, no questions asked. And the whole family helped my family take down shirts that were displayed on high, helped us find clothing in our size, helped us re-hang up everything... They were all a big hit (the son and the daughter, especially). What nice people. \n\nWe ended up getting a Montreal hoodie and an official Habs jacket which I love and have gotten a ton of compliments on! We also got various sundries and tchatchkies.

For a Star Trek gathering in Las Vegas, this convention is U.S.S. Enterprise huge!\n\nWas always intending to come to this convention since it's right at home, and present and past intermingling with fans!  Great gathering of nerds and geeks alike!  I got star-struck by folks like LeVar Burton, Marina Sirtis, Brent Spiner, and Jonathan Frakes!  No Picard though this round :-(.  For a nominal fee you could get a pic and auto from each of them!  And these folks were friendly as ever.  Just passing by there were no divas in the house.  Hell, even the original SHAFT, Richard Roundtree was there! *Shut yo' mouth'\n\nLots of convention space and a number of dealers to get your Star Trek swag!  No joke, I bought no Star Trek swag, but scored big time with some Star WARS memorabilia I've been wanting for years.  And paid a pittance for them.  Ha Ha!  It was fun to roam around the hall and see what everyone was offering.  I've been meaning to get to this convention, thanks to Groupon I finally answered the calling!  Only a mere $10 to get in!  Wasn't all that bad considering it's held at the Rio Hotel & Casino every year, fun place to play, see some ladies in teeny bikinis!  Only this trip it was people in Star Trek cosplay, and a lot of folks wearing red shirts.  If you don't know Star Trek, a red shirt in an episode meant you were marked for death!  Later, sucka!\n\nNot the biggest convention I've been to (thanks to San Diego Comic Con) but definitely one of the funnest.  Trekkies and Trekkers (YES there is a difference) abounding everywhere!  After all the passerbys and the requited \"Live long and prosper' hand signal stuff, I was inside the inner sanctum!  It was cool just walking the convention floor and seeing all the amazing stuff I would probably never be able to afford.  Show-used prop phaser, anyone?\n\nBut this convention is about bringing Star Trek to the fans!  And there was a lot of seminars and shows abound.

After a few months it became clear to me that this place is nothing but a money mill designed to fleece the gullible.\n\nI'll start off with the good, as there actually is one thing. Most of the instructors are really good with kids. They make the classes very fun and my son loved them. However that ends the positive portion of this review.\n\nThe thing that pushed me over the edge was after about two months of training my son \"qualified\" to test for the yellow belt. I was given a paper informing me of his great accomplishment and then letting me know I had to pay $60 for the test by a certain date. If we paid ahead of time they generously reduced the fee to $50. \n\nI can't say how many things struck me wrong about this. Paying $60 to test a 4yo for a belt is just ludicrous. And what exactly are we paying for? It isn't the instructor's time, as they cancel all classes during testing week, so the classes we paid for aren't being given. It certainly isn't the $2 worth of fabric used to make the belt.\n\nThis belt test fee prompted me to google and see if this is an industry standard. To my chagrin, but not surprise, I learned the term \"McDojo\" and found that Brandon's ATA fits every single criteria for my new vocabulary word. What is a McDojo you ask? Here is the definition off the McDojo FAQ -- A McDojo is a school that teaches a watered-down and impractical form of martial arts in the name of making money. They place the importance of profit well ahead of teaching anything realistic or credible in terms of self-defense, and are dangerous is the aspect that they send unprepared & often over confident students into a world thinking they can fight when in actuality they have no real fighting skills. Often McDojos teach a lot of bullshido, which is a term used to define deception, fraud, and lies in terms of martial arts.\n\nThe FAQ also lists Red Flags that your school is a McDojo and \"if the school exhibits any of these, even just one, it is a 100% McDojo.\" Sadly Brandon's ATA squarely hit the first two points on the list as well as #3 and and #4, leaving only #5 in doubt.\n\nThey make you sign a contract that locks you into months or even years of payments. They have a ton of belt colors, including the seriously made-up camo belt, as every belt color means more dollars into the belt money-mill.\n\nIronically, even after reading all this on google I was still happy to pay the $125\/month since my kid was enjoying the classes, but was unwilling to pay the testing fee. However they were unwilling to compromise on the belt-testing fee so we quit. In the end it turned out to be for the best -- I describe the new school we found in the last paragraph.\n\nOther incidents and observations about Brandon's ATA--\n\n--My son was rarely if ever corrected on his forms. Even I could tell he wasn't the greatest but he was routinely given a stripe on his belt for the most half-assed form. His effort was good, but his skill was not so stellar.\n\n--A few weeks into our experience we had what the school calls an \"evaluation\" but I would term a \"sales pitch.\" Essentially I was told my son was doing amazing and we should change to the leadership track. We signed up for the student track which is $125\/month for two 30-minute classes a week. Leadership is $175\/month for unlimited (during their scheduled times) one hour classes a week. My son was actually enjoying the school enough at the time that I would have been willing to fork out the $175 until we hit the catch. To do \"leadership\" you are also expected to pony up $700 (!) for a bag of \"necessary\" equipment. I can't believe people will pay that much for a young child. Children have the attention span of gnats and when they decide they don't want to do karate any more you're left with $700 of crap you'll never use again.\n\n--I met another family there who had been conned into pre-paying for their son for a year. And, of course, the predictable happened and he no longer wanted to do karate. The mom told me how they had to drag him kicking and screaming to each class. \"Luckily\" for them they had a younger son who wanted to do karate and the school let him finish out the older brother's contract. But this just goes to show why this school forces you into long term contracts. The whole time we were there they had a sign encouraging you to \"pay off\" your contract for 20% reduction in price.\n\n-- A new child started a couple of weeks before the test week was about to start. He performed the moves of the day in the same uncoordinated and sloppy fashion as my son (actually my son was marginally better) and was awarded not one but TWO stripes on his belt. Did he get two stripes because he was so awesome? I think not. He got two stripes because testing week was nigh and you need three stripes for them to get $60 off you for testing. \n\nMore to say but hit 5001 character limit...","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The watch required repairs several years later and I took it back to him.  He basically priced my repairs so high that he tried to convince me to purchase another watch.  I walked out thinking that their business practices were way to \"shady\" for me and swore I would never be back.  I had that watch repaired for a fraction of the quoted price elsewhere.  13 years later, I still wear that watch. \n\nSo, after my trusted watch technician closed down, I had no other place (in close proximity) to go to other than Canadian Watch Imports at their new location at 392 Spadina Ave.  \n\nI went there rather begrudgingly.  I went to repair my watch band and had a vintage watch which needed the glass replaced.   I dealt with Vic who surprisingly remembered the watch he sold me and even remembered the year.  He offered me a few choices on bands which I found to be average to expensive.  \n\nVic was honest with me when it came to replacing the glass on the vintage watch which he said was next to impossible.  He provided me with a few options and offered his genuine opinion on a replacement.  \n\nI replaced the band on my watch which cost $48.35.  He waived the fee for the 2 steel pins (which he replaced) and 4 cuts in the band to make it fit.  For a grand total of $54.64.  I appreciated the fact that he didn't charge me.   I was still weary that I was going to be hosed somehow.  \n\nI came back a few days later for my vintage watch glass replacement.  He still hadn't completed it, but as soon as I showed up he immediately attended to the repair which took about 10mins.  He did a meticulous job.   That cost me just over $50.  \n\nWe got talking about some of the negative reviews he has had regarding his business.   I really think he is trying to improve his customer service.  He is genuinely concerned about his business reputation, and I learned that he would rather repair watches properly with genuine parts, then use cheap replacements as he identified on my current watch that my 'trusted' watch technician had previously replaced.   In fact I saw him turn away a customer that was insistent that he replace a part on his watch with an alternative part and he refused.  Vic later explained to me that he would rather have a customer walk away then provide an inferior service.  \n\nI'm not saying that he has the greatest interpersonal skills, he's not rude, but it's all business with him.  I think if he were to take his time and talk to customers like he did with with me, people would warm up to him.  He is an intelligent person who takes pride in his work....he just wants to be sure he is going to get paid for it and that can come across the wrong way sometimes.  \n\nWill that be cash or debit?","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I'm writing to express my dissatisfaction with their product and service in hopes that they can either remedy the situation for future customers, or at the very least warn others away.\n\nI bought a watch strap that I was reassured was strong and long lasting. I insisted that I didn't mind paying more, but I wanted a strap to last more than a year. The strap lasted two months (the glue came unstuck that held the fastener).  I returned the watch, with the receipt, and asked for a refund or for a new strap.  (I didn't want to get the same strap as I suspected the same would happen. )\n\nI asked to see another strap (that I was told was worth $49), and I asked to pay the difference (I had paid $44 for the first strap that had broken).   My offer was refused.   \n\nThe salesperson told me that I had got my strap wet (the watch is not waterproof, and so I didn't get it wet) or had sweated on the strap. I pointed out that one does expect to sweat a little on a watch strap, and that it should not cause it to fall apart. In the end the shop replaced the broken strap with an alternative strap that I didn't like, because I insisted that I should get a refund.  Through out the interaction the salesperson was rude and obstructive. \n\nA much better way of dealing with customer (and one that perhaps might let the sales people sleep a little better) would have been to admit that the strap was faulty, apologised to me having to return it, and offered to replace it with the same strap or another, and had me pay the difference if the new strap was more expensive. \n\nInstead, the shop has created another angry and upset customer.  One gets the feeling with this place that they are not being honest, no prices on anything, and they are constantly reassuring you what a deal you're getting.

(of course, you have to pay tax on top of it and the tips)\n\nI actually bought two coupons, and I was going use them separately, but the person who does the booking said the job that I need to get done, it's better to have two maids and full 3 hours.\n\nThat is fine by me, so I used two coupons at once, and then I also list out the job items that I want to get done around the house.\n\nI have emailed and called to book the appointment probably a week earlier.

Vacuuming the entire apartment throughly\n2. Cleaning the 2 bath rooms I have including: wiping the counter tops, wiping all the faucets, clean the toilets and clean the mirror. \n3. Please remove soap scum build up from both bathroom\n4. One of the bathroom I have has a shower instead of a bathtub, so I need the door to be wiped clean. \n3.

Please clean behind the stove and fridge, need to be vaccumed and use cleaner to wipe clean. (both appliance can be easily pulled out)\n9. Please wipe all the shelf and furniture and I just want to make sure they look dust free.\n10. If there are some time left, please wipe the living room floor.\n\nthe oven, I already put the degreaser, so all the maid had to do was to wipe it off. The stove was not pull out and cleaned behind even though it has wheels. The floor was clean but only on the tile area, the hardwood was not wiped.\n\nOther than that, everything is spotless, but I am not sure if I want to use this company again.

The name says it all. One time, I my eyes were bigger than my stomach and I ordered the triple Butter Burger and could not eat it all. Way too much food along with a small fry and large diet coke ( I was dieting at the time! haha!) \n\nSeriously, besides Wendy's, Culvers is the only fast food burger joint I will eat from. Really enjoy their service whether it's drive thru or dine in. The staff, while typically high schoolers, are very nice. \n\nSome things to note:\n\n1. Pop (aka soda) is typically flat regardless of what kind you get\n2. Drive thru on Fridays is ridiculously long. You cannot even get into the parking lot and resort to parking across the street a the Associate Bank.\n3. They Walleye Dinner is seasonal but is also their 2nd best item on the menu. 3rd would be their chicken tenders which are 100% white meat and VERY fulfilling\n4. Pricey. You can easily spend $20 for two people.\n5. Flavor of the day typically sucks. Sorry. It's rare that I pass by and see a flavor I want to stop and order\n6. Wish they would send out more coupons. Earlier in the summer, they will send out a variety of GREAT coupons you can take advantage of such as by one burger, get the 2nd free. Love it when they dish out them coops. \n7. Not the biggest fan of their fries but they aren't bad.\n8. Boring Salads. Not friendly to dieters!! Be warned. \n\nCulvers is a great family oriented restaurant to eat it. They are a step up from fast food in my opinion. \n\nSpecial Note:\n\nCulvers CATERS! Yes. This is something many people do not know. Call your nearest Culvers for more information.

The menu is filled with traditional pasta dishes mixed in with some steak and seafood dishes.  The food is prepared well and quickly.  We've had excellent luck with their pasta and appetizers.  Although I would recommend avoiding the bacon wrapped piece of bread that offer.  \n\nThe service is professional and you have the impression that the waiters have been working this same restaurant for the 50 years this hotel has been open.  \n\nThe only sour spot we received was when we insisted our checks be split up (which we requested at the beginning) and they didn't do it.

This must be the torture a parent goes through when asked which child they love more. Unless you ask my parents. It is obvious I am the favorite. I love both of these businesses so much and when it was announced that they would be doing a joint event, I jumped on the chance to be in one of the limited seats available.\n\nYonaka took lead with the menu and Snow Shavery played a vital part in elevating the dishes presented to us. We started with a palate cleanser of lemon shaved ice with frozen grapes. This was a treat during this blistering summer. Next was hamachi dish. I say that I don't like certain foods, but it never stops me from cleaning a plate. Hamachi is one of those fish I tend to shy away from, but good luck tearing the dish from me. The touch of grapefruit helped to mellow out the flavor. The fried bun with mixed seafood salad and fresh pickles were phenomenal. A group of us went back yesterday and it was added onto their happy hour menu. It is worth getting. The next two dishes helped put us all in a food coma. When they spoke about communal dining, I was not expecting a whole sea bass for every four individuals. If that was not enough than a plate of pork belly for every six made me want to take a nap. The fennel and apple slaw that accompanied the fish was amazing. I could eat a whole plate of that by itself. The citrus and pears paired well with the fattiness of the pork belly. I was ready to tap out until the dessert came out. Chocolate ganache with three kinds of strawberries, fried milk, and green tea snow was deadly. I ate mine and began devouring those around me. At the end of our three hour meal, I could not think about food again for the rest of the day. \n\nThank you Yonaka staff for staying until 5am to set up and turning around to serve us at 11am. Thank you Will and Mike, from Snow Shavery, you do produce the best product in Vegas. I cannot wait until the brick and mortar opens up in Chinatown.","useful":2,"funny":2,"cool":3,"type":"review"}

After my fantastic first visit to Yonaka, I was so excited to see this opportunity pop up and booked my seat as soon as they were released. We arrived at noon on the dot and were pleasantly surprised to see the sake tasting that was available for us. I have to admit we spent quite a lot of time trying nearly every sake available. This alone was worth the price of admission. \n\nFinally, it was time to take our seats and indulge in a heavenly smorgasbord that was presented to us. They started slow with the chicken yakitori and shishito pepper and mushroom skewers with bonito flakes as an appetizer. Then came our amuse of lemon snow ice with frozen grapes. It was delightful and so light and subtle. Great way to tease our tastebuds for what was about to come. Next was the hamachi which was accompanied with serrano peppers and grapefruit. Nice and spicy but still very refreshing and flavorful. The scallop with melon snow ice was next and it was delicious. Very interesting and innovative dish. The fried bun was insane and blew me away for a bit. This was my second favorite course of the lunch. \n\nThere was a bit of a lull while we waited for our next servings and we took the opportunity to chat with our tablemates and get a few more tastes of sake. Finally, we took our seats again and the next course was presented. The whole Mediterranean snapper arrived at our table and everyone's eyes bulged right out of their heads. We were shocked to see a whole fish for every four people. Fantastic. The skin was spectacular and so flavorful. My favorite dish of the meal. The yucca chips were pretty addictive as well. I could eat these instead of potato chips any day.  Large portions of braised pork with egg, cashews and served with a side of rice and tempura were also served at this time. This is when the gluttony reached a peak. Just when we didn't think we could eat another bite the desserts arrived and they didn't disappoint at all. Green tea snow ice with fried milk, chocolate infused with green tea, balsamic strawberry puree, strawberry paper and milk dust. This was the perfect finale to our four hour brunch. \n\nI can't sing the praises of this event enough. It was beyond my wildest dreams and I can't wait to attend another of these now monthly meals again really soon. Thank you to everyone and Yonaka and Snow Shavery for a lunch to end all lunches.","useful":9,"funny":3,"cool":10,"type":"review"}

Words cannot describe how excited I am that this bakeshop is here.\n\nIt's named after Dulcinea from Don Quixote.  How cool is that?!

She has baked for several other businesses before opening this shop, including a stint as the head pastry chef of Casbah.  I'm so glad that she opened this bakeshop, though, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels this way!  This is the kind of place where you can expect creative, seasonally inspired twists on all your favorite pastries. Things are made from scratch, from quality ingredients, and you can really taste the difference. I had a slice of the cheesecake with dulce de leche that she made from scratch. It was the best piece of cheesecake I have had for as far back as I can remember.  I felt like I had died and gone to heaven!\n\nI also had two slices of delicious sausage and pepper quiche.  I asked only for one, but because the shop was closing soon and the owner is super nice, she gave me an extra slice!  I was extra glad for that once I tried it.  The crust was perfectly done, super crispy and buttery, and the filling was very flavorful with a good texture.  Plus, I loved the high crust-to-filling ratio, since the crust is my favorite part.\n\nI will definitely be back lots and lots.

Yes!\n\nI came here on 10\/30\/10 to browse with my sister. I love going into antique stores because #1, the quality of the goods is fantastic because everything is from the days before planned obsolescence. Goods were built to last. #2, The prices are fantastic. I could either go to the Forever 21 and buy $15 cheap-o made in China garbage accessories that will break in two weeks, or get a 60+ year old piece of costume jewelery that will last another 60 years for $10. \n\nWhile I was in the store, two little faces caught my eye. I spotted the most luxurious mink scarf there that I was drooling over. 4 little minks, sewn together. I snapped a quick pic of it and after browsing the store for a bit more, I went on my way. \n\nSince that day, I've looked at that picture a million times, forwarded it to friends, left hints to my family about how I wanted it, but I never made it back to Boulder City. I don't think I've ever regretted not buying something on the spot before, until I saw that scarf. I was terrified somebody else was going to snap it up. \n\nToday 1\/12\/11, my dad, youngest sister, aunt and uncle and I all went out to go visit the dam. I asked if we could go \"visit\" \"my\" scarf at the Antique Depot. We stopped on in after going to the dam and I didn't see the scarf! I went up to the desk, cell phone in hand with the picture of the scarf already up on the screen. I asked the nice lady behind the counter if they still had this scarf for sale. She looked around for about 5 minutes before finding it behind a lot of fur coats. She said they had to put it away because so many people were messing with this scarf. \n\nIt was priced at $75, I asked if the price was negotiable. She said $70, I asked if she'd be willing to go to $65. She said she meant $60, not $70. I was sold. For $64 and some change, the famed mink scarf was mine! \n\nIt looks great, especially for it's age. The lady at the counter said it was from the 1940's making this baby about 70 years old. She said she feels that it's important that these furs are displayed, rather than rotting in the back of a closet or in a box. Somebody a long time killed these animals, they were sold and worn and gotten rid of. It's the least I can do to save these animals from the garbage heap so they can be enjoyed. They did not die in vain. \n\nI will for sure come back to this place because the service and prices are fantastic!","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":3,"type":"review"}

Walking or in a boat- either one will work here.  You approach the cave, not knowing what to expect, and you're pleasantly surprised by the initial experience.  You're going through, enjoying the cave and looking at everything it holds.  Then, you reach a point when you say, \"Is there an end to this thing, or am I going to wind up in Beijing when I get out of here?\"  That pretty much sums up my experience at Antique Depot.\n\nDespite coming from an area of Pennsylvania that is infatuated with antiquing, I've never been.  Sure, I've been to some vintage stores and second-hand places, but nothing that actually specializes in \"antiques\" (which to me, is a loose definition).  Anyway, after stepping out of the car in Boulder City, I found shelter from the heat in the first place that I saw.  I'm not sure what I was expecting before I entered, but I do know I was pleasantly surprised when I made it inside.\n\nYou start off in a small room that houses their most prized pieces.  This is apparent by the uniqueness and quality of these items.  It is even more apparent by the exorbitant prizes.  I'm not sure if the pricing is an accurate reflection of what you are buying since this was my first experience shopping in an antique store, but to me the prices seemed high.  Expect to see paintings, vases, stemware, and old coins in this room.\n\nThen you make your way to a hallway that has several small rooms off to the sides each with a different theme.  Some themes I noticed: dresses and accessories, Christmas, and records and cameras.  There was also a room that had lots of old photographs which I found pretty interesting since most of them came from studios in Pittsburgh.\n\nAs you get through all the rooms down the hall, you then enter another large room that has dolls and toys.  This room was pretty fun since it not only had antiques but also some toys from my heyday that brought back memories.  I considered buying an item or two just for memory's sake, but again found the prices a little high.  So instead, I enjoyed seeing them again and moved on.  \n\nThen I started to get that whole \"where is this place taking me to?\" feeling.  There was yet another hallway to wander down (housing neon signs and artwork) and it lead to some scary backroom.  Ok, so maybe it wasn't so scary but I was growing concerned in this incredibly narrow and impossibly long store.  I was worried I might be in some sort of trap... But instead I just saw some old furniture and cookware and some not-that-really-old books.  There was another little side room that you could look into but was blocked off that held some of the better furniture.  \n\nI finally reached the end and didn't wind up in some underground tavern or time portal!  \n\nIf you're really into antiquing then I would highly recommend you stop here (or the town of Boulder City, really).  There is something interesting for everyone and everything is clean and as organized as it can be.  Again, I'm not entirely sure about pricing since I've never shopped in an antique store before, but to me the prices seemed a little high.  I could definitely be wrong.\n\nFun stop in Boulder City, just make sure you're ready to see some scary old Santa dolls in their Christmas room!  (They could easily give the weak-minded nightmares).","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

If you don't offer eyelash extensions, WHY did your shitty worker just slowly say \"no..... not now.....\" are you KIDDING me?!\n\n\n...!?!?! Do you not want to run a business?!!?\nAt that point, my friend was like \"whatever, let's just go then.\" \n\nI'm so confused at this type of behaviour from a service that mostly earns from tip.. service based industries.. you need to learn that a short conversation can potentially lose a loyal customer forever.","useful":0,"funny":3,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

The other nearby restaurants seemed too crowded or fancy, and we just wanted a comfortable, casual place to have supper. We peeked in the window and saw that it seemed to be a low-key kind of place, so we tried it. And, as Barry said, the food surprised us. My teenagers had pasta, which was very good, and I ordered osso bucco, which was actually delicious, and we all had a nice fresh and colorful salad. My impression was that the food is like good home cooking. The vibe is great if you are not looking for a sophisticated experience. There was a hockey game playing (silently, thankfully) on the TV, my son struck up a conversation with one of the cooks who kept coming out to check the score, and the waiter was attentive, professional and pleasant. We will go back.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

We checked out Yelp and some other sources in advance and settled on a couple of places that served pizza as our primary targets. It happened to be a particularly cold evening and before we left the hotel, the kind manager at the front desk suggested a third spot, \"just in case.\" Never having been to the area before, we felt our way, through the strange streets and the increasing chill in the air, to Rue Dante, where our first dinner choice turned out to be a bit upscale for Pizza. While the place seemed pretty busy there also appeared to be plenty of room for at least two more. Wrong we were. As it turns out, all those empty tables and chairs were 'booked', we were told by a very snooty hostess and there was just no possible way we would be enjoying pizza in their very popular spot on this particular Friday night. No worries, because as it turned out, that back up eatery suggested to us on our way out of the hotel was just down the block. On the way, we passed another decent looking place and as we walked with purpose  through the frigid cold Canadian evening we agreed we'd circle back if necessary.   Sure enough, chic hot spot number two - only half full with customers - was also \"fully booked\" and we were SOL once again. The owner was kind enough to send us down the street to yet another place he told us he \"eats at himself\" and of course when we got there, it was completely out of business. Guess it had been a while since he enjoyed their cuisine. At this point we were cold, hungry and starting to feel like we were trapped in a surreal film with food everywhere yet nothing we could eat.  So we doubled back to that place we passed between our first two rejections and sure enough, it too was completely booked. Strike three! How was this possible? It was 7:30 on a Friday night in Montreal and apparently impossible to eat in \"Petite Italie.\"  We had just about given up, as we walked passed the most popular pizza place in town and saw two hours worth of crowd waiting outside in the cold. And it was at that moment we spotted Tratotoria Casa Mia. On the doorstep was a guy wearing an apron and stealing a smoke. Inside 6, maybe 8 folks enjoying their meals and plenty of other unpopulated empty tables. The feel was casual and comfortable, but was there room for us? The nice Italian woman reading her paper at an empty table got up to greet us and before we knew it, our Montreal dinner nightmare was over. Within  minutes, that same Italian woman would be in the kitchen cooking up our meal.\nOur waiter, busy as he was taking care of all the tables, was welcoming, took our order quickly, made sure we got our bread and beverages while we waited and in good time, brought our lasagna and pasta, too.  And much to our surprise, considering how empty this place looked and how no other restaurant in the area would even let us in, the pasta and lasagna were both really good.  In short, this was a terrific little restaurant that apparently is not part of the \"scene\" in \"Petite Itlalie\" which is too bad because the food was terrific, the service was good, the prices were more than fair and the people who run the place were flat out warm and welcoming.\nIf you find yourselves in \"Petite Itlaie\" at some point without reservations, skip the crowds, skip the \"scene\" and skip the most popular joints in the hood and slide into Tratorria Casa Mia for lunch or dinner, instead. It's worth it not to wait.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

When I reached them via phone, the person I spoke with very rudely informed me that she simply didn't have the time to answer my very brief and routine questions.  Although I was taken aback by her lack of customer service skills, I figured I'd give her the benefit of the doubt and called back at what I figured was a more convenient time for an apparently short-staffed establishment, yet nobody answered the phone at all.  Shortly thereafter, I sent All Around Learning Center a very brief email inquiry about their course availability.  I received no response.  Apparently, they are so short-staffed that they cannot be bothered to provide a potential client with even a one sentence reply.  I, as a result, will discourage other interested parties from providing this company with any of their hard-earned money.  If All Around Learning Center conducts business by ignoring potential customers, I can only imagine the dissatisfaction experienced by those who've already paid their unreasonably priced fees.

The bar is nice enough with a couple plasmas and appropriate amount of black and gold on the walls.  However, the bar itself was a bit sticky.  I was greeted quickly by a nice enough chap who brought me a paper and asked me for my drink order.  I had there iced tea, which was ackwardly served in a small pitcher instead of a glass.

I ordered a cup of the chicken dumpling soup, which I thought was a bit overpriced.  The soup arrived quickly and had a decent flavor although it was served kind of room temperature and underseasoned. Soup should be served steaming hot.  I also tried the pulled pork sandwich and collard greens.  The pork itself was okay, tender and all that.  However, it was also served relatively cold and underseasoned.

Some people love it, some people loathe it. I'm in the middle. I can appreciate good Christmas music, but most of it is just too cheery and too cheesy. But, I brace myself every year after the huge Turkey dinner digests for the holiday music season. I patiently wait through the month of December opting to play songs like the Counting Crows' Long December - the best December song ever - and avoiding the radio. \n\nWith all that, I complain about Red Hot & Blue because yesterday, not only did they play the worst Christmas music, they played the worst music tracks I could possibly imagine in a restaurant. They played this awful mix of bad bluesy\/jazzy Christmas music, Jackson 5, Alvin & the Chipmunks, a bad remake of \"My Favorite Things\", and some other ear-bleeding music I didn't recognize. Not only was the selection awful, they played it so loudly that I couldn't just tune it out. The waiter came over and asked \"is everything okay?\" to which I smart-assily said, \"The food is good, but the music is definitely questionable.\" He chuckled and agreed, then walked away. I hoped that it would mean he would end the torture, but he didn't. \n\nI think the food was okay, not the best Red Hot & Blue I've eaten, but it was acceptable. I don't love their BBQ sauces, which is probably the most important part of BBQ. The Beef Brisket had a little bit of fat on it, which I welcomed.  The fried okra side was my favorite part of the meal. Other pros: our waiter was friendly and attentive (except the part where he doesn't turn off the music) and the water comes in this small pitcher, per person, which is the amount of water I typically need with dinner. \n\nPerhaps I would have liked the food more if I wasn't trying to inhale it so quickly. Who could blame me though, the music was an alternate form of torture. \n\nNote to restaurants, the music you play does count for something.

The guacamole, however, tasted fresh and was really yummy! The green salsa was also delicious. I ordered the \"Breaded chicken torta\" which came with a tasty chipotle sauce. The chicken patty was thin and looked slightly processed but the sandwich was decent overall. My boyfriend got the steak burrito which he loved! He stole some of my chipotle sauce because he loved it so much!\n\nThe food is surprisingly better than the service or atmosphere.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

We were excited about the food - especially the burritos. We were careful to arrive at 8p because we saw that the groupon was not valid during happy hour (from 6 - 8p). \n\nWe arrived and there was no one there to seat us. Most people were drinking but there were three or four tables of people eating food. We wandered in and found a seat at the only table available, which was dirty. Finally, a disaffected server wandered by and inquired: this your glass? Why would we have just one, half-full glass of water between us on a table? \n\nThat aside, he offered to take our drink order and we asked what was good. He didn't have anything to suggest; he just said \"we can make whatever.\" We asked for a drink menu and when he brought it back he told us that the kitchen was closed. We were surprised and he said that they'd run out of food. They had only opened two hours ago and they'd already run out of food? He didn't apologize at all - just matter of fact: kitchen's closed.\n\nWe were very hungry so we decided to go eat at Plum instead and come back for drinks, which is what we told the server. He had no real response, except to say \"ok.\"\n\nWe returned about an hour later to find a surprise cover of $3 each. We weren't happy to have to pay a cover for a place we'd never been to (I'm not a big fan of jazz, anyway), but we paid it anyway. There were no tables available, so we sat at the bar, which was covered in spilled beer (which we cleaned up with the napkins available - no help from the bartender). The bartender was quiet and didn't seem to have much personality -- we asked for a drink menu but there were no cocktails listed (perhaps the menu was missing a page?), so we looked them up on their website ourselves.\n\nMy drink was overly sweet and cloying: I suppose I should have expected that from a drink with blue curacao - my mistake. The bartender couldn't remember my friend's order and so she ordered it twice. Her drink was literally the worst martini either of us had ever tasted. He forgot the olives and when he finally brought them after a second request, they arrived on a cocktail napkin.\n\nFresh food was rolling out of the kitchen at a rapid pace - nearly half of the tables were eating freshly cooked food. No mention of the missing food from earlier and no offer for a menu (not that we would have eaten, but it made me wonder if those with groupons were not offered food for some reason). \n\nTo make matters worse, the beer tap sprayed beer backwards every time the bartender pulled a beer, resulting in beer on our faces and clothes.\n\nTo sum up? This place is amateur - if I didn't know better, I'd say they'd just opened up a few weeks ago and hadn't gotten into their groove (having enough food in stock to go more than two hours of business without running out of food, having all of their menus consistent, having a clean establishment). But the reality, judging from some of the existing comments, is that they've been open for long enough to know better.\n\nThe drinks were over-priced ($10.50 for a martini? Not when you forget the olives and serve it with a lime!), the service is inexplicably bad and downright dismissive, and the food -- as delicious as it may have looked online and at other people's tables -- was mysteriously not available to the likes of us. Add that with a my-excrement-doesn't-stink attitude out of a bar\/restaurant that looks to have been designed by my four-year old niece, and you've got yourself an experience to be sure.\n\nWe certainly won't be going back to AVA and I recommend you steer clear, too.","useful":1,"funny":2,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

This place beats most indoor play zones in the USA. The only thing that deters me from visiting more often (and makes this review a 4 instead of 5 stars) is the price for admission. However, as ANNE MARIE J stated (kudos!), it's much cheaper to go in the afternoon. I personally prefer children activities earlier so that we have the rest of the afternoon and evening to do as we please without worrying that the kids are getting restless from extra energy. Perhaps one day I'll try the afternoon visit before we leave Germany.\n     Our youngest really enjoys the water play area from which he gets soaking wet. Our older two play in the jungle gym area and the slides most of the time. The great thing about this place is the ability to relax in the lounge area. It has couches for a more comfortable seat while you read a book, work on your laptop, or just dose off for a bit. \n     The cashless system is great, but it's an easy way to run up a bill if you're not careful. It's easy to keep ordering from the coffee shop, eating pastries, or splurging on limitless pizza for the kids. The pizza is actually pretty good. Now that the kids are a little older, we can let them run around freely until it's time to go. \n     Definitely plan on a 4-hour (or longer) visit when you're here with kids. They do also host dance parties on a regular basis. If you 'like' them on Facebook, you will see their upcoming events on your newsfeed. CAVEAT: nocturnal events are for adults only.\n     Enjoy! =)","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Es ging um rund 15 Euro, die zu viel berechnet wurden. Erst nach langem Hin und Her wurde das Geld zurückgegeben. \nHier sehe ich eindeutig Verbesserungspotential: Es sollte eindeutig nachvollziehbar sein, was konsumiert wurde.

Lots of parking available which was easily marked with signs and\/or staff directing you.  For the elderly there was golf carts for assistance in getting to the facility if they parked too far.\nSome parts of the Surprise campus was under construction which meant walking on dirt pathways into the facility.\nDress is casual which for me I thought unusual.  Call me old fashioned but I thought we had to dress up for church as a sign of respect...oh well, I guess the times have changed.\nStaff\/employees was super-friendly and welcoming.\nBefore heading into the auditorium for the mass, there's a small bookstore\/gift shop and a small cafeteria that serves breakfast, lunch and coffee\/tea.\nThe auditorium was small but they informed the congregation that they were expanding so the small surroundings was only for a short time.\nMusic is loud, live, on-stage, uplifting and broadcasted on screen for everyone to sing along.  Although there are some staff that come upon stage to talk, the main message is usually conveyed on screen and pre-recorded which was a bit of a turnoff for me as I expected a live on-stage presentation (-1)\nAs for the on-screen message, I too wasn't impressed (-1) as I was expecting the presenter to take a verse from the Bible, take it apart, examine it, and apply it to everyday living but that wasn't the case as they talked about a central theme - as of writing this, the theme they discussed for this week was on Wisdom.\nNewcomers weren't expected to tithe but it does seem that the church expects 10% of one's salary for tithing from what I've read on their site.\nThere's no formal confessional booth so I'm guessing one was supposed to confess personally then choose to accept their communion which was passed around on a platter rather than coming up the aisle as in a Catholic church.  The platter that is passed around consists of small bits of crackers (didn't resemble wafers) and small cups of grape juice.\nMass was held for an hour with homework given.  Another turnoff for me was the pushing of social media (like Tweeting on Twitter about your homework readings given) by the presenter on-screen. (-1)\nAfter mass, newcomers were welcomed to approach the welcome desk where they were asked to supply their address, email, and phone number.  I only supplied my address and email and have noticed that I have started getting both mail and email which I had unexpected, yet another turnoff.\nVery questionable if I'll be coming back to nourish my soul here.","useful":3,"funny":3,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

He was unresponsive to requests even as simple as to return a call. Monthly statements listed vague description of fees\/charges. When he was questioned about the fees, his usual response was it was within his right to approve charges within the threshold limits as stated in the contract. Make you think who owns the service companies he uses. Tenant were placed for 3 months and then had to be evicted. The eviction fees were costly, questionable, and paid to Action in the form of various \"admin\" fees. In the event of an eviction, they made more money than they would keeping the tenant for the term of the lease.  I'm sure they were thorough when they so-called \"screen\" the tenant. We decided to part ways with Action and Terry only to find out that it was going to cost thousands more to do so. I would be very wary in doing any business with these people.

Our meals came out on HUGE plates, sizzling hot. More than I could eat in TWO meals. And so good! The rice was cooked perfectly, the mixed vegetables also (cooked but still slightly crunchy), my steak was rare, and the chicken was so succulent it was like eating a forbidden fruit. I'm not exaggerating too much!\n\nThey brought out the shrimp and ginger sauces in squeezable containers (like you'd find mustard and ketchup in). Worked for me! I didn't have to ask for more, which I usually do at a Hibachi place.\n\nSo-I got all-you-can-eat salad\/soup\/dessert AND delicious Hibachi that I made two meals out of... for $8. EIGHT DOLLARS! How can you afford not to love this place? The food was FANTASTIC Hibachi!\n\nOther notes: They DO serve beer, serving traditional Japanese beers and a few domestic. They also had plum wine! They DO have a TV. I happened to be there while the Masters were on. They DO have a lot of room. Could serve huge groups. They DO have kid friendly food.\n\nAll in all-TRY THIS PLACE! I will definitely go back again and again!","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

My wilty side salad listed as $2.50 on the menu was $4.95 on the bill.  Finally, I noticed that the Apple juices for my 2 young daughters were $2.25 each, then looking back at the menu saw a smaller size available for less which the waitress never mentioned or asked which one we wanted.  \n\nWhen getting ready to go, we were never offered boxes for the leftover French fries and as we picked them up in the paper the were served on, the waitress walked by shaking her head.\n\nUpon paying, the cashier asked how everything was in which my husband answered it was just ok.  The cashier did not even question or seem concerned as to why that was his response.\n\nSo not only did we have a terrible food quality experience but were overcharged and\/or ripped off on just about everything we ordered.  \n\nI will not hesitate to express my disappointment and disgust for our entire Eddy's Deli experience to everyone I know.  A truly awful and overpriced dining experience!","useful":5,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Gave this place a couple of chances, but no more.  The last experience sums it up.  Outside of business is unkept - very tall weeds surround the building and the grass is a couple of weeks overdue to be mowed.  Once we went in, had to wait at least 2 minutes to be acknowledged - all employees were in the back doing who knows what - none came out with customers orders or anything for a customer, so who knows?  No friendly greeting when we were acknowledged, just \"how many\" and \"follow me\".  Once seated, we had to wait for a long time for our waitress to come over - she was shooting the breeze with a 'regular'. When she took the order, it was short responses at best. And when I didn't say the type of bread, I received a very curt \"what type?\"  When the food was brought out, it was plopped on the table and the waitress walked away.  Nothing about whether we needed anything else.  Had to flag her down for A-1 - I ordered steak and eggs, so being asked about this should have been automatic, I would have thought. When I looked at my food, most of the home fries resembled grizzle and the eggs, which should have been over easy were much closer to scrambled. The toast was heated bread.  Could have complained, but didn't bother.  The waitress did ask later how everything was and when I said \"so-so\", she didn't seem overly concerned and didn't ask anything else - just going through the motions.  When we checked out, she didn't even ask how it was.  She just took the bill, said the total and we paid.  No thank you, nothing.  So...with all of the other options in the area for good \"home style food\", why on earth stop here?  That is, unless you're a regular - there does seem to be a different standard of treatment for that group.

When a resto cuts too many corners or does it too brazenly (say, by mixing milk with the already-cheeseless bleu cheese side to buffalo wings... God...), sometimes it'll make or break whether or not I go there again.  Because, you know, when you love to cook, you notice that kind of thing.  \n\nBut then there are those places that completely surprise you, places where you can't help but smile when you compare both expense and expectation with what it is you've received on your plate.  Such was my eye-opening, palate-happy experience with Yummy Bar-B-Q.\n\nIt isn't a feast for the eyes, and the truth is that the slightly beaten-down look of the place kept me away for a while before I finally crossed the threshold.  The sloppy, hand-scrawled signage along the walls and the intimidating enclave that hides the kitchen from the dining area definitely kills any sense of ambience making this a date-worthy joint... but the food.... whoah.\n\nI was grabbing a fast lunch during my workday, and was stunned to get a fabulously spicy mountain (mountain, I tell you) of chicken, stirfried veggies, and nutty Korean rice for about five bucks.  Yeah, you read that right.  And for another buck or two, I could have added tofu and traditional kimchee to my plate, even though what I already was looking at was enough to feed two.  \n\nSimilar lunch specials are available with beef, pork, squid, shrimp, or simply vegetarian.  Dinner entrees feature a variety of barbecued dishes (all of the above meats plus charcoaled mackerel), plus the noodle, rice, stirfry and other dishes that might expect from an Asian resto.  No entree is priced above twelve bucks, making this ugly but delicious spot a choice locale for the budget-conscious, spice-loving foodie.  \n\nAnd they serve beer.  Ooo.","useful":1,"funny":2,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

We had a bibimbap, beef dumpling soup, and spicy rice cake. I think I eat Korean food so often that it has become hard to impress me. Bibimbap is almost universally good. Song Cook has my vote on best bibimbap because they have 7 vegetable types and use very fresh ingredients. Yummy's had 5-6 different vegetables and a nice egg on top. Good enough for me. The beef dumpling soup is delicious and very good portion. Taste is light enough to my liking and doesn't taste like msg. My only complaint is with the rice cake. I thought they added too little fish cake and noodles but it's not a big deal to me. Taste is just like any other generic restaurant's rice cake (it tastes good).\n\nThe atmosphere is your typical mom & pop feeling you find in Korean restaurants. I generally don't care about atmosphere so I'm being neutral here. I like to pay for good food, not the atmosphere. \n\nOverall, the food doesn't really stand out. It's highly edible. While there's nothing special about the food, I recommend this place if you're looking for great value. Some items are as low as $6.50 and their prices INCLUDE tax. So it's a bargain considering the portions and quality of the food.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

(Unless morbidly curious...)\n\nOur somewhat stunted little province is rife with these mysteriously expensive food chains that serve this flavorless & nutriionally-bereft quasi-food garbage. Service was helpful to my inquiries; I ordered a chicken burrito, and the toppings actually looked fresh made if the tortilla didn't (it was on the verge of cracking). Way too much in a hurry to assemble and not properly heat through, though there was little solid food in it to heat I guess. The smattering of chicken tasted re-heated and salty, the sauce toppings weren't bad but the fresh veggies & particularly the onions tasted stale, stale, stale. The 'cheese' was barely present in flavor and may as well have been (or was it actually?) colorful wax shavings sprinkled on the somewhat miserly contents that altogether did not really satisfy.\n\nI did get through said pathetic 7-dollar burrito, and though that was a rip off there was at least a sale this week (um, the deal gets worse?). But if this is what 'gourmet' fast food has become, I'm opting out. What a ripoff. Seems like the place was designed by yield managers whose sole and soul-less aim was to empty your wallet cynically & efficiently allowing the least imaginable enjoyment or health benefit possible.\n\nQ: Is it THAT hard to make decent cheap TexMex takeout east of the DVP? Burrito Boys on Peter Street kicks this place in the keister. People are not stupid, you know and the Beach has its share of doubters when it comes to eating out down the block. What a stupid, cynical farce of a resto chain this is, there's no way Z-teca will last here or ever make money. Certainly what they do take in money-wise doesn't show in quality.\n\nHere's a sharp business idea: when it comes to food you have to give an actual shit and not serve virtual shit.

It doesn't know whether it is an office, (the manager's desk is in the dining area.) a cafe, an ice cream parlor or a kitschy antique store.\n\nThe store had no real antiques, just the sort of craft work one generally finds at the swap mart.\n\nThe menu is that of a brunchery with french toast, omlettes, egg dishes and baked goods. Sounded good. Unfortunately the execusion is where this cafe fell flat.\n\nThe sausage and cheese omlette was obviously microwaved instead of being prepared in a pan on a stove, topped with a single slice of American processed pretend cheese. The french toast tasted very much like it was taken from the freezer and popped in a toaster. \n\nBacon and sausage were of the lowest order, the bacon being so thin you could have read the paper through it and possesing no actual flavor at all.\n\nThe promised \"homemade\" biscuits were such a disappointment that they went unfinished. I have had better biscuits at McDoanlds. Honestly, and McDonalds makes dreadful biscuits.\n\nOverall we were extremely disappointed in this little cafe and became even more so when the check arrived. The total price for this disaster was almost the same as if we had gone to a real resturaunt  but without any thing that approches the satisfaction one gets from dining on good food. The waitress\/cook\/manager very cheerfully gave us discount coupons for our next visit, we left them sitting on the table.\n\nThe food was actually so disappointing and we ate so little of it that we  then went someplace else to have our breakfast.\n\nIf you're hungry and are thinking about stopping by The Apple Dumpling Cafe for a bite, I recommend McDoanlds, the food will be cheaper and NOT microwaved, and be moderately better tasting.\n\n*******************************************************************************\n\nWell, a few days after posting this review I received a meesage from an owner of Apple Dumpling Cafe and after due consideration I thought I'd add my response to that message here as well. I will use their statements then respond to them, promotional comments have been edited out. Also I should like to point out that the location we visited is now closed and they have a new location in Queen Creek.\n\nADC: \"We have been in the Restaurant and catering for 25 years.\nYes everyone has some off days. At Apple Dumplings, we cook everything up fresh, no cooking items and keeping them warm. Fresh eggs, not powdered or liquid eggs.\"\n\nDBABH: Now between my wife and myself we also have nearly 20 years of restaurant experience, everything from family dining all the way up to 4 star restaurants. We know what good food tastes like, this wasn't it.\n\nADC: \"Maybe you are not used to baked biscuits instead of warmed microwave ones.\"\n\nDBABH: Being a native of the west I have had my share of delicious, tender and tasty biscuits from campsites to local restaurants and no, the biscuits at the Apple Dumpling Cafe do not qualify. They were of poor quality and neither tender nor tasty.\n\nADC: \"Our business is growing in Queen Creek. Our Apple Burger has been called one of the best in the country by many.\"\n\nDBABH: I am sure the business is growing and that is a good thing. But the new location is far enough out to discourage this reviewer from giving them a second chance at the apple. Perhaps if I were in Queen Creek one day for another reason I might stop in, but given the low quality of food we received on our first visit I think the odds of that happening are long indeed.","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

On this and previous vacations here we have enjoyed eating our breakfast al fresco at the pool cafe. However, with the addition of the City Center complex and thanks to a line at the pool cafe we have found a new favorite for breakfast at Silk Road in Vdara. It is simply one of our very favorite places for breakfast EVER!!!  \n\nWe just ate there the past three mornings-phenomenal!  I can't say enough good things about it and the waitstaff- a different one each day and they were all The French press coffee is smooth and perfectly brewed.  We had omelettes the first day with pastries and the tropical fruit. The omelttes were solidly good and the tropical fruit excellent with beautiful presentation and a decadent side of sweet tahini yogurt. There was even a half of a fresh lilikoi (passion fruit)!  \n\nThe second morning we again shared a continental breakfast with pastries, juice, and coffee along with the tropical fruit.  I chose the morning sliders-two small tenderloin sandwiches and a third sandwich as a take on bacon, egg, and cheese all on brioches. Wow!!!  My husband had the turkey hash which was also fabulous!  It is a hash of turkey and potatoes but with an alluring blend of Turkish spices and topped with two eggs.  Soooo tasty! \n\nThis morning we had the same as yesterday except I tried the signature Eggs Eggs Eggs dish and my husband opted for egg whites scrambled on top of his hash. The Eggs Eggs Eggs dish is a trio of takes on classic egg dishes-a poached egg atop the turkey hash topped lightly with hollandaise, a fried quail atop a tasty fried (but not greasy) potato cake, and scrambled egg served in a shell upon steamed spinach all topped with a light salt foam.  Oh boy!!!  \n\nOverall everything was get-it-again worthy. Can't wait to eat breakfast here again on future trips!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

It has fantastic food with none of the attitude found at many highly rated restaurants.  It is a great experience from the moment you arrive.\n\nIt's a busy spot to be sure but a wait for a table doesn't seem too bad when you belly up to the beautiful bar at the rear of the restaurant.  \n\nI highly recommend the \"Anti-Freeze\" frozen martini.  Top shelf Vodka, Blue Curacao, pineapple juice and Madori.  A couple of those while you wait and you won't care if your table ever becomes available.  It's the best drink I've ever had - hands down! \n\nIt's somewhat difficult to \"pigeon hole\" Primadonna from their menu perspective.  Definitely has an Italian influence but also has a distinct Asian feel to it as well.  Suffice to say though, their menu is quite diverse and full of unique items and combinations to suit any palate.\n\nI have dined there three times, twice with a large party and each time we ordered the huge sushi boat. It was fabulous!  Even if sushi is not your cup of tea, you just may like the sushi at Primadonna. \n\nThe third time was a party of four and I ordered the grilled salmon.  It was excellently prepared and came with some corn salsa, rice and beans.  I was a little surprised by that combination but let me tell you, it all works together.  It was very good!\n\nThe atmosphere at Primadonna is current.  It's got almost a club vibe to it and is a very entertaining place to eat.  The last time I was there (party of 4), we got a table overlooking the sidewalk.  It was a beautiful summer night, the large picture window was open and it was almost like dining Al fresco.  \n\nThe service is phenomenal.  Each time we were there, we had a different server and, while each had their own unique personality, all were not only competent, but FUN!  It seemed they were having as much fun as we were but ALWAYS got it right when it came to service.\n\nMy only regret is that I live in the Chicago area and don't get to Montreal near enough.

A big part of the success of the sandwich came from the bread and herbs.  The person sitting next to me at the bar ordered the ahi tuna and it looked bad, barely seared on the outside.  Another person sitting near me ordered the personal pizza (they dont call it pizza though).   Be prepared because it is tiny and looks more like an appetizer than a meal.  The place is new, so i will give it time and another chance and hopefully there will be many playoff games to give it another go.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

This place is a must stop for any grocery shopping list.\n\nThe most obvious advantage to Aldi is the price... groceries here are, overall, much cheaper than anywhere else.  There really are some ridiculous deals here.  Orange juice, cheese, canned goods, and produce are especially cheap.  They only sell so called off brands of things, but they all taste just as good as the overpriced name brands.  The produce generally looks pretty good, though definitely take a look over the packages of peppers, tomatoes, and onions as occasionally there can be a rotten one hiding inside.\n\nThe biggest drawback is the lack of selection and the ever changing selection... The selection is small as the stores in general are small, but they use the space wisely with stuff packed in on stacks and pallets and little shelving.  The stuff they sell tends to change often, which can be frustrating when you can't find that awesome thing you found last time.\n\nCheckout is a bit odd here as well.  First, you have to put a quarter deposit down to get a shopping cart.  This is not really much of a hassle, but is just strange... I don't see the purpose other than making sure people return their carts to get their quarter back.  Also, they don't have paper\/plastic bags at the checkout, so bring your own, buy one of their cloth bags, or be prepared to have a trunk full of loose groceries.  The cashiers here are very efficient... maybe too much so.  They really move fast, just kind of throwing stuff into the cart at the end of the checkout with little regard for glass or squishable items like bread or produce.  That being said, none of those are major problems.\n\nI go here pretty much every week for much of my grocery needs.  It doesn't have everything, but it has mostly everything.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The inexpensive chips and snacks greet you when you walk in, and as you meander down the aisles, you're hit on each side by non-name brand and occasionally name-brand foods!  \n\nAldi's has a great center rack with household\/interest products, although I've found this particular one seems to be pretty well ransacked every time I stop by.  \n\nOverall though, this Aldi's, like the others, is Amazing!

I ended up going through the isles getting a BUNCH of items for my classroom, my students, as well as myself! Fortunately they also have donated posters that are free (no points needed) that you can take so take advantage of those as well. \n\n**The only downfall is that you may have to pay attention to signs that say *limit ___* meaning you can only take a limited amount, but come on.

They sent me a letter saying rates were going up, so i cancelled my account with them. 5 days later they decided to take money out of my bank account after i had cancelled. Well it's been 2 months now and i finally get a check back from them. The check was short. i am so pissed off at that god damn company. After calling 5 times and waiting for a damn check to come and the short my pay back and give me some shitty excuse that there was an extra Sunday in the month so they charged me for it. Which in my eyes is BS. Makes no sense that i pay month to month and then they say oh there was an extra paper in there so we are charging you for it. I said i paid every month before i received any papers so it makes no sense that was charged again for something i had already paid for. I hope that damn building burns down!! It is not much money but its the fucking principle of the matter. fucking rip offs!! i asked to speak to the supervisor and got no where with them, so i asked to speak who was in charge of them and got a fucking answer machine.

We were looking for an instructor & school that offered a class that was not only sufficient enough to satisfy Nevada State requirements for a Concealed Carry permit, but one which was informative, exceeds that criteria, fun & at a competitive legit price rate. My buddies came across 3 Dot Sight Group, owned by Eric P. Kelley. We decided to contact him and inquire regarding the who, what, where, when, why & how investigative questions & to our surprise he catered to us with open arms in a respectful and exciting manner. He wasn't trying to sell us, as he offered insights and questions of his own in which he wanted to find out what we were looking to get out of the class. Since we were a group of 12, he offered the class at $70.00 per person which includes 8 hours of classroom training, Nevada law, real life scenario, what to do incase you are involved in a shooting, ways to ensure liability issues, safety & inspection of fire arms, fire arm handling\/stance, actual range time for the shooting portion and the written test & much more! Mind you this class is for Nevada\/Arizona conceal carry permit. For additional carry states it is a little more & more in depth.  \n\nWe took our class on Saturday January 23, 2016 & had 3 instructors: Tim, Mike & Eric...all of who are wonderful characters in their own way. All 3 were very knowledgable with years of background in law enforcement & military. Big Mike is a little intimidating at first but Iike big soft bear, you don't want to mess with him, but very nice when you know what he is all about. Class room is small in a room that could fit approx 20 students if need be. I think it is an excellent size considering the more personal level and attentiveness acquired both ways through instructor and student. All in all, it was a great & interesting experience. Our group had a fun time and even plan to take additional continuing education\/class skill levels. I would highly recommend 3 Dot Sight Group and Eric if you are looking into getting a CCW permit or if you just want to be informed with anything firearms. These guys are great and even want you to give them a call if you have any questions. They are not just a one time class but are there for any situation.","useful":5,"funny":3,"cool":4,"type":"review"}

WEll, I can understand that. Our youngest had a couple of good size scratches the first time she went there and you know what, thats normal! They are dogs for crying out loud. Dogs are animals, not your children, although we are as close to ours as if they were. People need to realize that dogs have sharp teeth and like to wrestle and play rough. \n\nLet them be dogs! It took us a couple times to come to this realization as well. But now we 100% accept the fact that our youngest who loves to roughouse, loves to wrestle and play is almost always going to have marks on her. That is not the fault of the kennel operator.\n\nAnother idea for people who don't want their dogs interacting with other  dogs is to checkout Petsmart. Sure they will charge you twice as much and the 18yr old kids that work there often forget to feed your dogs but at least you won't have to worry about them running around.\n\nOh yea the fact Liz puts up videos on Facebook everyday is a HUGE plus for us.

Not exactly a five star club and minus a star for the lack of air on the dance floor. But overall it's a good place to get your dance on. \n\nI gotta say I do love the dance floor since it lights up and it's good to at least see what you're stepping on and how icky the dance floor can get with spilled drinks, a tampon, straws, and someone's broken heel... ok ok kidding about the heel but i digress. lol. \n\nI like that you can roam around, upon entering the club you see the craziness and crowd of ppl by the bar and dance floor which are surrounded by booths and stripper poles situated between the booths. You also notice on the walls two big screens where music videos play of the song that everyone is dancing to. There's also a second floor in which there are two ways to get up there, either by the winding stairwell outside or the back stairwell which leads you to a dark hallway by the restrooms. It's pretty nice because you can roam be like a creeper. \n\nNow, i've been to countless clubs and know a thing or two of navigating through a crowd to get close to the bar or get in the middle of a dance floor to get at least some shoulder room. The same rules apply to Disco. The bar is crowded by the entrance but as you get through the first two waves of ppl there's room to the bar to get a drink. Prices are reasonable by Scottsdale standards. Crowd is very low key and not as douchey unlike the patrons found down the street at PCL, DP, and Axis. And it's a mixed crowd as well. DJ plays a good mix, and overall a fun fun place to just dance. Of course my complaint at this DISCOtheque is the lack of circulating air. It seems the air vents are by the bar area and entrance. I think it wouldn't be too unreasonable and gaudy if fans were in place to at least alleviate the hotness permeating on the dance floor. Also, would it hurt to at least have a few more go go dancers... hot guys and girl dancers are not a bad thing. Just saying. But I like overall vibe, no cover, reasonable drinks, and good music makes this a fun stop in the old town circuit on Sat. nights.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Back in November of 2014, I somehow tweaked my back at the gym. I began to experience lower back pain that made it hard to sit comfortably. After a week, I scheduled a visit to a chiro (not Banks) who immediately began \"treatments\". This doctor never offered a consult or took an x-ray. After two months of visits, sometimes twice a week, the pain worsened. Many nights were spent not sleeping and getting out of bed became a chore. It felt as if my lower back was severely tight and all twisted it up. Bending down to tie my shoes was beyond difficult. After one day spending 20 minutes of trying to get out of my car to go in to work; I knew something had to change!\n\nI googled, found Pinnacle and took a chance. Upon my first visit, Dr. Banks sat with me and provided an in-depth consult along with treatment options. I expressed my fears of being side-lined with chronic back pain; in which he reassured me he'd do everything he could to remedy the pain. After an x-ray and my first treatment, he gave me the best course of action and promised that within a month, he'd like to see my back at 100% with little or no further visits. After a month of weekly treatments, my back was back to normal. No pain whatsoever!! I was able to walk, bend, sit, stand and sleep---PAIN FREE! To me, it was nothing short of a miracle. The best part? No further visits were required. It is now June of 2016 and I'm still pain free. I recommend anyone with back pain to consult with Dr. Banks. He's extremely knowledgeable and he and his staff CARE. Thank you for all you've done!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

It was something I'd always order at restaurants and even make special trips to the West Towne Mall food court to hit up the Steak Escape.  I've never even been to Philadelphia and I probably wouldn't know a good cheesesteak from a bad one.  It didn't really matter - that is what I yearned for, and my wishes were answered when Charley's opened.\n\nBack then I went all the time, usually getting the regular Philly with fries but basically trying everything on the menu.

I skipped the fries as I never was a huge fan and went with a large sandwich.  Long answer: not quite so much...  It turns out I'm not used to eating this type of food anymore, and the heartburn became intense around the second period.

The Pharmacy staff are not friendly (the cashiers at the front are always smiling and friendly) but pharmacy staff provide zero patient care.  They did not ask me anything about my previous medications, what I am taking, if I have any allergies  (and I have a severe allergy) and if I was even pregnant which I clearly was showing.  When I went to pick up my medication the cashier just handed it to me without providing me any information on the new medication.  Most importantly, without providing me any medication, there was not even a sticker on the bottle indicating it must be consumed on an empty stomach and no grapefruit no warnings, nothing spoken to me, just handed it to me.  I had to do research myself when I got home since they did not provide me any information. I felt I was at McDonald's getting fast food, not a drug store where a medication can kill me. The Ontario College of Pharmacists should pay close attention to this store. I thought patient intake or when they hand you your medication they are suppose to ask you questions and inform you, or has the laws changed recently? \n\n Not to mention the newly renovated Shoppers Drug Mart (same store, just moved a few blocks west) is not AODA compliant and does not meet building code, if you are in a wheelchair you cannot even get down the aisles.   I went with my neighbour and she had to leave since her wheelchair would not permit her to go up the first aisle this is unacceptable for a pharmacy. The aisles are filled with stands in the middle of the aisle impeding even able body people.  How can a store open and a drug store to boot and not be compliant to building code?  For this reason, I am never going back to a store I cannot even get down an aisle.  So many people in the beaches are complaining about this especially those with strollers, walkers, scooters or wheelchairs you cannot get down an aisles. Complaints have been raised to the manager but nothing has been done yet.  Hoping someone from head office pays a visit and tries walking down each aisle and put yourself in someones shoes. Get a measuring tape out and measure, each aisle is clearly different widths and each aisle gets smaller and smaller as you go east, who designed this?  The architect should have caught this error especially if it does not meet code. Even strollers cannot get by, it is not right for a brand new store not to meet AODA compliance.  A helpful hint is if you walk sideways and shimmy and try not to hit all the structures they  placed in the middle you may be able to squeeze by but only if nobody happens to be in the aisle. If there is, you will have to wait. I have been in this store 5 times since and each time I hear numerous complaints from other customers about this but nothing is being corrected, they just keep adding more crap in stands in the middle of aisles.\n\nThere are plenty of other independent drug stores in the area where the pharmacists takes the time to explain your medication to you as well as asks you questions about what you are presently taking and treats you like a patient not  number and you can actually fit down the aisle.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The problem is that there are no signs telling you what anything is, the flavors, etc. and their demeanor from the moment I walk into the door makes me feel uneasy even asking them about anything as they are very unwelcoming. They actually seem agitated that you're even there, even as you walk in with a smile. It does deter me from going there from time to time.\n\nTasty baked goods. Lousy and unwelcoming staff. Maybe keep the miserable women in the back kitchen away from the public, and bring in some personable girls for the front.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

So although it might be above your budget, you might just get something thatll last you a lifetime. its also much more palatable for me to go to a place like this in my neighbourhood thats small, where there is one proprietor who is likely to know her stuff and where I can go to quickly as i discover what my kitchen lacks.  Plus it feels like you are walking into someone's home--someone who is obsessed and crazy about cooking, crazy like ive-read-kitchen-confidential-by-anthony-bourdain-a-billion-times-and-sleep-with-it crazy mind you, but homey nonetheless.  so if im going to save up, this place is the place ill frequent to see whats up and make my kitchen that much better.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I swear by everything, I would not use this shuttle company even if it was FREE!!!\n\nPurchased Shuttle Passes ($30 for one day) over the phone at approx 2pm and was advise to go to Palazzo to pick up the pass and be picked up there.\n\n-Upon arrival, there were no signs leading to the shuttle pick up area. Seriously impossible to find. I probably wasted a good 15 minutes trying to find it.\n-Started lining up for shuttles at 645pm more or less (with ~80 people ahead of me) and was informed shuttles were running late. \n-First shuttle did not arrive until approximately 730pm, but to our surprise, they were MINI Shuttles! They shuttles could only hold 25 people with some sitting on the floor. How ghetto!\n-Second shuttle came at approximately 815pm, and my fiancee and I knew we had to get on this bus or we'll never get to the festival. We got and assumed all our troubles were over. The driver didn't know how to get there or even worse, where the 15 Freeway is!!! The 15 is the main freeway in LV and if you can't find that freeway you're screwed\n-3hours and 50 minutes later due to poor planning by 1NS we were still not at the event. My other friends who took the Insomniac (EDC) Shuttle got their between 45 minutes and 1hour before we did. Their drivers knew better routes and the fastest way to get there. Since we relied on googlemaps, we instructed the driver the directions we got.\n-At approximately 11:15 PM, the driver had to pull over to urinate. Half the people got off the shuttle and decided to walk 4 miles. The other half including myself remained. However, people on our bus started to use the restroom, so we figured we should leave too, not knowing when they'll be back and our concert started at 7pm!!!\n-Upon walking this 4 mile distance, another 1NS shuttle broke down, go figure!\n-After 2 miles of walking on a road where we shouldn't be walking, I decided to hail for a cab. I did not check into the concert until approximately 12:10AM!\n-Left the concert at approximately 430AM and myself and another 500+ people had no idea where to find our shuttle company. There were no signs posted and people, they will not pick up their phone for you. You'll get transferred to an automated message. Once the sale is done, they'll walk away. After searching for 1 hour and 30 minutes for our shuttle, we luckily stumbled across some people who were also looking for the same shuttle company. I pushed n shoved because I did not want to get stranded there til who knows. My fiancee and I luckily got on the bus and we departed at 630 AM more or less.\n-Due to poor logistics again, we did not arrive back to the Palazzo until 830AM (18 mile drive).\n-I thought we had it bad, but some people had it even worse. They had to sneak onto other shuttles and some were stranded as late as 1130AM without any indication of when their serviced will be rendered.\n\nI have never filed a charge back against a company but I will do for the very first time.\n\nSTAY AS FAR AS AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY. STORIES ARE ALL TRUE. THEY ARE SCAMMERS. OVERBOOKING and claiming they have 8-10 shuttles.

But if you can make it to the top, you'll find the Vegas valley (and Lake Mead) laid out before you to the South and a great view of the desert wilderness to the North.\n\nGass Peak is located within the Desert National Wildlife Refuge and is the highest summit (6943 ft \/ 2116 m) in the Las Vegas mountain range (mountains that form the north-east barrier of the Las Vegas Valley). The only way to get to the hike is to head north on 95 and turn right onto a dirt road towards Corn Creek (turnoff is near mile marker 101).  Word of warning: you'll need at least a high-clearance vehicle to drive the dirt roads in the Desert National Wildlife Refuge and a 4x4 vehicle is recommended.  Stop at the visitor center and ask for directions to Gass Peak road (marked, but located about 45 minutes down some unfinished, rough and rocky desert roads--so worth some good directions from staff).\n\nOnce you get to the trailhead, you'll face the steepest part of the climb up front--old roads now closed to the public that seem to go straight up and make your thighs and lungs burn.  But push through that and you'll be on a winding trail (sort of -- you're following the marks made by people and animals, rather than a maintained trail).  The trail winds up and around to the ridge of some smaller peaks.  From there, you'll keep walking up and along mountain ridges (always looking west to the cell tower that marks Gass Peak).  Once you're up on top of the smaller peaks, the climb gets easier (although steeper and there's a lot of slipping and sliding on the steeper paths).\n\nBut keep going and you'll reach the peak looking out over the Vegas valley.  There's a log book at the top with people signing in or leaving their thoughts while looking out over a desert metropolis to the South and an almost pristine mountain wilderness to the North.  Best view I've found of Las Vegas and you'll earn the view with all the incline exercise.\n\nAs usual, BirdandHike has an excellent description of the hike and great directions:\nhttp:\/\/www.birdandhike.com\/Hike\/DNWR\/Gass_Peak\/_Gass_Peak.htm","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":3,"type":"review"}

Gass peak imparticilar has called to me like a forbidden siren.\n\nMy great friend Paul W and I developed a plan to summit Gass peak a year ago. There are some Web sites that provide detailed and easy to follow directions to get to the trailhead and ultimately, the summit. We researched as much as we could and set a date. With perfect weather and an early start, a long time goal was about to be reached.\n\nThe 95 to the corn creek turn off was well marked. The road to the ranger station was newly paved. This turns to a rocky dirt road that provides appropriate signage. Take the Mormon wells road to Gass peak road. The mountains and rock formations along the way are visually spectacular and resemble beautiful anger as different minerals and rock have battled for turf rights millions of years ago.  Like a great rock\/earth battle field, you will quickly forget Las Vegas is 40 or so minutes away. \n\nThe trailhead is obvious. It's a service road that you will need to follow to the right. You can gaze upon the summit from the start. It will call to you and taunt you along the way. There are multiple steep stretches of trail and very few flat ones. You travel along the spine of a prehistoric ridgeline that holds on to the view of the LV valley tightly. As you ascend the trail the valley quickly drops and provides a vast view of the diverse and impressive landscape. \n\nThe top gets closer and the trail gets steeper. I would recommend some training before you take the 3.1 mile trail up around 1700 feet. Also water, lots of water. The summit has a large Antena and building with some big solar panels to absorb the plentiful sun and fuel the comm needs of the valley below. There is a nice area to unload, stretch out and take in the great accomplishment of making it to the top.\n\nMy friend, Paul W and I have made many hikes and summits and loaded down our packs to train hard so that we may hunt easy for this particular adventure. As with any summit, it's euphoric to stand atop a mountain and gaze down into the valley below. This summit was even more so gratifying due to the fact I've been looking at this peak for my entire life. \n\nWe ate at the summit and replenished our fuel and enjoyed the view for an hour or two. 360 degrees of great views almost overwhelmed our senses. With great sadness we had to head down and release our grip of the summit victory. The decent back into the valley is equally as beautiful and changes around every draw and corner. Be careful on the steep parts. The trail is well marked and ranges from limestone to jagged rock to sandstone to a volcanic wonderland. It is well worth the effort and a hike I will never forget.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

A dragon whom had snatched a virgin princess whom was never to be seen by anyone again.  In this particular case, there once was a dragon called Gass (Peak).\n\nIn 1996, I arrived in \"The Meadows.\"  When I would eventually get my bearings and properly orientate myself to the valley, when I looked north I spied the monstrosity.  A curious glare would be cast down from above like the eye of Sauron when the sun would hit an angle along it's ecliptic.  I would gaze on high and feel as if the summit called to me.  Better yet........mocked me.  It's taunts beckoned me to slay the beast and rescue the princess.\n\nTime would pass and pass..........and pass.  Every morning I woke up and went about my business anywhere in the valley, when I looked north...there was the beast in all of it's magnificence...scorning me.\n\nAlmost 20 years later, two knights (Zack M. & myself) with the passion of Don Quixote, formulated a plan to slay to giant.\n\nWith one war chariot left at a nearby reservation, the two would take another more robust war chariot to the base of beast, slay it, and rescue the fair maiden.\n\nThe path is well traveled and recently paved heading out to the Nevada Wildlife Refuge.  At the only intersection, the direction (Mormon Well Road to Gass Peak Road) was easily illuminated.\n\nSmaller chariots were observed in the area but be forewarned, this is a rough road.\n\nThis journey is not for the faint of heart and it is highly recommended that if attempted...in the months especially when it his hotter than Hades, one should plan for every contingency because despite the illusion...you are in wild country. WATER!\n\nSome 35 minutes of travel you can expect to find a very recognizable trail head.  At this trail head, arrows were literally shot and heavy packs were laden on the backs of the knights in preparation for future battle.  \n\nThe two would march off looking to climb the spine of the tarragon.  A word to the wise...when you meet the fork: TAKE THE RIGHT even when everything is telling to take the left.\n\nUp and up went the knights (who took a left and then blazed their own route).  Strengthened by previous adventures, they went higher into clouds.  When the beaten track began to fade, a cairn would materialize and show the way.\n\nFearing that my time is running short as are my yelp characters, let me speed up this tale. We made our way up the spine of the beastie and this knight's lower armor (shorts) began to sag.  Fortunately, beneath the armor lay another form of protection.  When I reached the summit this knight became a jester, as I was now wearing my armor around my ankles.  Armed now only with spandex, a timely spear of joy was thrust into the heart of Gass.\n\nThe princess (view) had sadly (but expected) already been claimed.  Many times in fact, but not by many yelpers.  The summit log is located between the benchmarks, and it was full of previous conquistadors.  Sauron is nothing but solar panels fueling the communication needs for various agencies.\n\nBut this was the moment of greatness for Zack M. & Paul W.  We celebrated our victory with song and the sweet taste of unicorn tears.\n\nHeading down what was now a trail of redemption and victory, my thoughts drifted to preparation for future adventures.\n\nAs of 02\/21\/16, when I catch Gass Peak out of the corner of my eye, I can't help but smile and feel an overwhelming sense of satisfaction.  GO SLAY YOUR DRAGON!!","useful":7,"funny":8,"cool":6,"type":"review"}

Aren't you more than first meets the eye.\n\nI seem to be going through a phase of reviewing chains, but if you'll forgive me my sins, sometimes the things you need are hard to find and the chains can provide. Holland & Barret is a chain, and there are several of them in the city. Edinburgh only has one big Boots on the Princes Street, 100 Starbucks, and 3 Holland & Barrets all within 20 - 25 minutes of each other (the other two are on Rose Street and Nicholson Street).\n\nI do stop in here to buy several items regularly, mainly their healthy energy bars and food stuffs. The Nicholson Street branch is my local and so the only one I've been into. I think I gave it a fairly middle-of-road review. It supplies most of the products I need.\n\nOr so I thought until I came to this branch. It wasn't planned. I was going to the optician next door and needed to get some things so thought I may as well whilst close by. The outside looks exactly the same as the outside of the Nicholson Street branch and appears to occupy the same space. But open the doors and suddenly it expands inwards like a tardis. And the first thing I noticed was a fridge unit! What the what?!\n\nI was in a rush and needed particular items so didn't have a chance to explore, but I will go back to do just that. The items I needed (protein supplements \/ bars \/ shakes and the like) were much  more expansive in range than in the Nicholson store too. So much so that I actually took a lot longer than planned and had to run for my bus. There's a fantastic range of different bars, flapjacks, ready-made shakes. I was looking to get the 'cleanest' type of protein supplements I could that weren't choc-full of sweetners, nuts and caramel (why are most of them fake mars bars?!) The ones I found did still have sweetners but there was a much bigger range that allowd me to pick the best looking ones. Again, really great range.\n\nThe shop assistant was also really top chat and banter. He laughed at how many protein shakes a wee waif of a girl was packing into her basket (I'm going away for 2 weeks and needed to stock pile) and we got chatting. Really down to earth, friendly and genuine. I love that sort of thing about customer service, and I'm proud to say it seems to be a Scottish trait.\n\nAnyway, this store is much bigger than some others I've been into. Whilst it's a chain, and can probably charge more than some smaller independents, it usually has great offers on (everything the store was buy one get one half price when I was in) and they are pretty much guaranteed to have the health supplement you need. I'll be returning to get more of those protein-infused berry flapjacks. Ooft.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

Ausnahmsloser Enthusiasmus an allen Fronten. Also waren wir neugierig mit leicht gesteigerter Erwartungshaltung, unter anderem auch, weil im ersten Anlauf andere Gäste schneller waren und wir mit dem Versuch, Freitagmittag für Freitagabend zu reservieren, leider nicht landen konnten. Also ächzten wir chronisch Kurzentschlossene und legten uns ungewohnt früh für den Freitagabend fest, in mehr als einer Hinsicht, denn uhrzeitmäßig schielte zumindest ein Auge auf das erste WM-Qualifikationsspiel gegen die Färöer.\n \nSo dachten offenbar auch andere, denn der Innenhof, in dem wir bei angesagt gutem Wetter reserviert hatten, war schon gut besucht. Man brachte uns zu einem größeren Tisch, der für vier gedeckt war und fragte, ob es uns stören würde, wenn sich noch andere Gäste dazusetzten. Ehrlich gesagt schon, war unsere Antwort, und sofort wurde klag- und kommentarlos die andere Hälfte abgeräumt und uns die Stühle etwas anders hingerückt. Sehr schön.\n \nGleich darauf kam die Karte, nett gebunden, mit einem relativ klassischen griechischen Angebot und einer auffallend großen Auswahl an Vorspeisen. Ouzo als Aperitiv war uns ein bißchen zu heftig, also Aperol Sprizz und weiteres Studium von Karte und Umgebung. Sehr übersichtliche Weinauswahl, offen dankenswerterweise in unterschiedlichen Losgrößen (0,2l, 0,5l und 1l) zu bestellen, weitgehend ähnliche Weine auch flaschenweise. Preisniveau griechisch-günstig. Der Innenhof nett zum Sitzen, geflochtene Lounge-Stühle und ordentlich große Tische gemischt mit Holzlattenstühlen nebst passenden Tischen. An den Mauern Grün, mit einbrechender Dunkelheit machten sich die Energiesparlaternen recht unangenehm bemerkbar. Die Kerzen in den hübschen Laternen auf den Tischen blieben während unseres Besuchs aus, schade. Vielleicht wurden sie später noch gezündet?\n \nWir fragten die freundliche Bedienung nach der Möglichkeit, uns eine gemischte Vorspeisenplatte für zwei zusammenzustellen, sie schlug verschiedene Cremes \/ Pürees und Gemüse vor, wir stimmten zu. Danach wollte mein Mann - Überraschung! - die Lammkoteletts und ich die gegrillten Sardinen. Dazu mangels anderer trockener Weißweinalternativen den offenen griechischen Chardonnay (der dann wie befürchtet nach nicht viel schmeckte)  und eine große Flasche Wasser, die mit € 3,50 geradezu sensationell günstig daherkam.\n \nWir hatten vorab noch gewitzelt, ob wir es ausnahmsweise mal schaffen würden, den Aperitiv zu trinken, bevor die Vorspeisen kämen. Tja, Pech gehabt, das Konzept des Aperitivs wird noch brauchen, um in Deutschland anzukommen, aber nur mal fürs Protokoll, würden Sie Aperol Sprizz zum Essen trinken wollen? Ich definitiv nicht.\n \nDie Vorspeisenplatte, die später mit € 6,50 pro Nase auf der Rechnung erschien, war ebenso klassisch wie die Speisekarte: verschiedene Schafskäsecremes, Taramasalata, Auberginenpüree, fritierte Zucchini- und Auberginenscheiben, fritierte lange dünne Paprika und viele Tomatenscheiben. Alles frisch, geschmacklich gut, aber das könnten wir im Diogenes genauso haben, da aber eher noch mehr Auswahl. Ich würde hier definitiv empfehlen, aus dem interessanteren Einzelangebot der Vorspeisen nach gusto zu ordern, das wäre bestimmt spannender gewesen. Dazu gab es gutes Brot, irgendwo zwischen Weißbrot und Bauernbrot, frisch und mit Biß.\n \nZiemlich genau in der Mitte der Vorspeise kam die Slapstickeinlage - eine Bedienung, die bislang nicht an unserem Tisch aufgetreten war, kam mit einem Teller Sardinen und wollte servieren. Wir erklärten, daß wir die Sardinen als Hauptgericht bestellt hätten und zeigten auf die noch gut gefüllte Vorspeisenplatte. Woraufhin uns beschieden wurde (O-Ton): \"Äh, die hat gerade ziemlich viel zu tun\", offenbar in der Absicht, die Sardinen bei uns abzuladen, was aber mit unserem Unverständnis \"wir sind gerade bei der Vorspeise, was sollen wir denn machen?\" kollidierte. Abzug des Sardinenträgers, Rätselraten bei uns am Tisch. Trainee erwischt? Sardinen zuviel? Fragen über Fragen...\n \nNachdem wir die Vorspeisen bewältigt hatten, dauerte das Abräumen ein bißchen, aber als dann der freundliche Herr kam, der uns empfangen hatte, schien die Feedback-Schleife funktioniert zu haben, er fragte nämlich, ob man mit den Hauptspeisen weitermachen sollte. Wir baten um eine Pause und bekamen die sehr nette und souveräne Antwort, man würde das selbstverständlich nach unseren Wünschen einrichten. Aufatmen unsererseits.\n \nNach einer angenehmen Pause kamen erneut Besteck und Servietten auf Beistelltellern (jaaa, das möchte ich ausdrücklich loben, es gibt viel zuviele Restaurants dieser Art die auf Mehrfachnutzung des Bestecks insistieren, was für mich 1A-Spaßverderberei ist - soviel Besteckbestand bzw.

Die freundliche Servicemitarbeiterin hat uns auch versichert, dass wir auf jeden Fall einen Platz bekommen und wir können doch schonmal Getränke bestellen. \n\nZum Essen ist zu aller erst zu sagen, dass das Taramas einfach unglaublich gut geschmeckt hat! Alle Daumen hoch! So ein gutes Taramas haben wir noch nie gegessen. Als Vorspeise hatten wir einen gemischten Salat sowie das Taramas, dazu gab es einen Brotkorb. \nAls Hauptgang hatte wir zwei Gyros (9,90 €), einmal Bifteki mit Schafskäse gefüllt und eine gemischte Vorspeise (als Hauptgang). Zu den Grillgerichten gab es jeweils selbstgemachte Pommes, sehr lecker. Leider war die gemischte Vorspeise etwas enttäuschend. Geschmacklich zwar sehr lecker, aber von der Auswahl eher sparsam. Da in der Beschreibung nur stand 'kalte und warme Vorpeisen' hatte ich mich auf eine super leckere Auswahl gefreut (da die einzelnen Vorspeisen wirklich vielversprechend geklungen haben). Allerdings gab es dann 'nur' vier verschiedene Pasten (Taramas, Schafskäse, Auberginen und Tzatzika). dazu gab es frittierte Zucchini und Auberginen und eine Peperoni. Wie gesagt, sehr lecker, aber trotzdem enttäuschend. Auch ist hier ein Punkt abzuziehen, da ich nicht noch einmal Brot zu der Vorspeise akka Hauptspeise bekommen habe und eine weitere Brotbestellung 1,50 gekostet hätte. Auf meine Nachfrage ob ich denn bitte nur eine Scheibe Brot haben könne, meinte die Servicekraft zwar ja klar, jedoch ist das Brot nie gekommen.\n\nAnsonsten war der Service auch sehr gut und aufmerksam. \n\nLeider gab es keinen Ouzo als Begrüßung\/Abschied so wie man es von vielen Griechen gewohnt ist. Macht nichts, wäre aber trotzdem schön :)","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Amazingly, they were able to deliver SAME DAY, so I took the plunge and ordered a double bed set to be delivered this afternoon.\n\nJassi's husband rang me up and he was also very kind and was able to put me at the end of the delivery schedule because I would have to take the streetcar back home to let the delivery guys in. \n\nLiving in a basement apartment, I have the teeniest of tiny entryways and was a little concerned the box spring wouldn't fit. With the precision of physicists, the two delivery guys were able to maneuver both the box spring and mattress down the stairs and into my bedroom. They even fixed the light they accidentally knocked off the wall trying to get my set inside!\n\nI am so impressed by Thrift Town, I will definitely shop here again and recommend it to anyone. Let's just hope my next purchase is easier to get into my apartment!\n\nThanks, Thrift Town, you've made me one happy customer! :)","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The clothes section can compete with a big Value Village, and some of the knickknacks are even better (there was an Xbox laying around when I was there). The organization, however, is a little less meticulous than the competition.\n\nThe real gold mine is the basement, where there's a ton (actually, likely tons) of old furniture, including at least half a dozen couches lined up on their sides. There's also a section of clothes sold by the pound; you probably wouldn't get lucky with something that fits and isn't hideous, but it's good to know if you need scraps or old clothes for other uses.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Je fus d'autant plus emballé d'apprendre qu'il m'était possible d'y goûter à la vietnamienne, c'est-à-dire dans les petits filtres métalliques qui se chargent d'infuser la mouture (qui est un mélange d'arabica et de robusta) à même la tasse. Si vous n'avez jamais pris un café de la sorte, je vous conseille de l'essayer. À ma connaissance, rares sont les endroits à Montréal où l'on a l'opportunité de tester cette simple cafetière. Portable, pratique, je dirais même que prendre son café ainsi ajoute un certain charme à l'acte!... Est-il bon? Très fort et sirupeux; on peut l'allonger avec de l'eau bouillante s'il est trop mordant. Vous l'aurez deviné; sa robustesse gustative résulte du grain robusta, plus rare dans nos tasses québécoises, mais beaucoup plus cultivé au Vietnam... Évidemment, la version glacée est aussi offerte.\n\nSi l'estomac vous travaille, vous pourrez vous repaître de salades exotiques, telles papayes, ou encore fleur de lotus, cette dernière que je recommande fortement, car elle est délicieuse et typiquement vietnamienne. Rouleaux impériaux, soupes, croissants, etc. figurent sur le menu. L'on peut aussi acheter sur place deux indispensables vietnamiens : du Nuoc-mâm de qualité, une sauce à base de poisson fermenté dans une saumure (très nauséabonde), et de la sauce chili. \n\nLe climat a cependant un petit quelque chose d'impersonnel qui ne m'a pas trop plu; film d'action américain mis en sourdine, jouant à la télévision, sur un fond très bruyant de musique d'ambiance latine...","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I did research before I chose them over PODS, reasoning that United and Mayflower have been in the moving business a long time.  What I found is that this company over promises and under delivers. We were told we would have 6 men, for as long as we needed, who would load our items and secure them with straps and tie downs for transport. It was at a cost of $2,000.  They sent 3 men.  We had 4 containers but only 3 arrived at our destination.  When that last container was delivered, the local rep could not raise the door, which was bowed outward.  The container had to be taken back to the warehouse so the door could be forced open. We were horrified by what we saw.  The Phoenix team who represents United Mayflower did not tie or strap anything down in this container, as they were supposed to.  When the unsecured cargo was tipped in loading and unloading, everything was flung forward.  Boxes of books, fragile items, and furniture flew everywhere. I was very glad I over did it with bubble wrap, as those items, which were upside down and had heavy boxes of books crushing them, survived. Our furniture was another story: two very nice armchairs are ripped. There is a huge gouge in the front of an antique cherry cabinet.  UM paid for being so late with the belongings, but when it came to the claim for damage, they stuck to the contract of insuring our belonging at a rate of .60 a pound. Choosing their insurance was very costly, and our homeowners insurer told us up front that our policy does not cover items in transit. That was a stupid choice by me, but I figured if I packed everything carefully, and paid UM for their Plus Moving service, all would be well. They stick to their contract for insurance, but ignore the fact that I did not get what I paid for manpower for loading and securing our belongings. By the time all is done, I saved NO money by using the container services in lieu of standard moving truck, and now am stuck with damaged good that will be expensive to repair.  When you move don't choose container services, and DON'T GO WITH THIS COMPANY AT ALL!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

For such a small place they really have a wonderful menu, and you can tell that the family that owns the establishment really cares about the product that they put out.\n\nThe thing I love the most about this place is that staff.  Everyone there is so accommodating, and always make sure that your needs are met.\n\nWhile this is a tavern I have always gone here for the food, and not necessarily to sling back a few cocktails after work.  Though sometimes the two go hand in hand.\n\nIf you're a first time visitor I would suggest you order the spaghetti.  I know what you're thinking, but it is by far one of their most popular dishes, and is just as good as you can get from any of CLE's \"authentic\" Italian eateries.  If you're looking to feed your inner dinosaur then you can't go wrong with the open face NY strip steak sandwich.  \n\nIt's the little neighborhood taverns like this that were built for the dwindling blue collar workers that once occupied the Westside communities.  \n\nThere's a real sense of nostalgia to the place that is hard to imitate, and can only be achieved by actually having experienced many many years of getting it right.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Couldn't find anything that came close to this place! \n\nI'm a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom large with the BIGGEST patio I have ever seen in an apartment, resort style patio doors all around, a nice gas fire place and a security system for 900$ a month. I love the location of it first and foremost, with us being a military family living close to Creech but not in the far NW was a MUST since I have to commute to Nellis. Just north of Summerlin, just south of Centennial and I have very easy access to the 215 and the 95. I will say, sometimes making a left onto Durango can be a bit of a pain, but there is a U turn not too far that I usually do. There is NO section 8 housing, or any government housing in this complex, and they don't make any favors for rent payments.\n\nThe staff here is great, Sherry and Ellen are fantastic. The maintenance workers are great too, always very polite,friendly and quick to fix any discrepancies. Only down fall is, they cannot do ANY work at night, so when it's July and your AC stops working at 8pm be ready to either sweat a lot or stay in a hotel. The pool is rarely ever crowded, and where there are people near the pool, they're very quiet, keeping to themselves. If you have any issues with your neighbors, they're quick to take action and the issues is always resolved. They're VERY strict with their lease enforcement rules, if you're the kind that likes to have a surround sound home theater in your apartment, look else where!  \n\nThis community is one of the few Vegas apartments that do not have a gate standing wide open all hours of the day and night, and there is NO key code, it's all remotes that open the gates, And I love that! Sometimes there will be a car waiting for the gate to open but if you're anything like me, I usually stop and wait for the gate to shut behind me. A LOT of residents do this to keep our community free of issues. Most residents have lived here for a long time, its rare to see people moving out. This complex houses a lot of military members,and short term housing as well with fully furnished units to rent.\n\nSo safety and peacefulness at night, well, it is SO quiet here at night, the only noise you hear is from the traffic on Durango! It's fantastic to live in an apartment and not have to worry about your vehicle, your patio, and almost all of the apartments have their own stairwell, so if someone is coming up your stairwell you're not assuming its the neighbors.  The night patrol is really great, they're always out walking the property, chit chatting with neighbors outside in the evenings and making their presence known. \n\nMy ONLY complaint about the complex is the master bathrooms are tiny, but the closets are giant. AND the master bed room gets REALLY REALLY hot, it's almost unbearable in the summer, there isn't much you can do about that either, it's a design flaw. \n\nI'd totally recommend this complex to anyone who isn't a partier, this place is not for them. Perfect for singles,young families,older families,and seniors.","useful":10,"funny":4,"cool":3,"type":"review"}

I love to find vintage boutiques with great stuff at good prices but even more important than what I find are the people who run the store and how they interact with me during my shopping experience. This boutique gets five stars for all of these merchant qualities. The City of Mesa should be proud to have such a great businesses in their City.  I found the most exquisite Italian stainless steel 3 piece sorbet set with a full 12 piece set in perfect condition. This is a one of a kind find that I could not leave at the store. Did I mention the fabulous price on this rare find. Susanne, Fifi and myself all came up with many ways I can use this set in entertaining at home with friends. Fifi also has beautiful authentic designer handbags at great prices. I plan on making one of these my next purchase. The worst part about finding this store is that I am not in Mesa full time. I have houses both here and in Las Vegas. I guess I know where I will be going each time I am in Mesa.  Maybe being in both locations is a plus so I don't spend so much money. \n\nIt is interesting because I found a Las Vegas designer\/vintage clothing store that I thought was also fabulous however I was treated so rudly the first and second time in the store I decided that no designer deal was worth being treated like I was inferior to the person I was paying. I will stick with Fifi and leave the unnamed store in Vegas to treat other customers rudly. The owner of that boutique banned me from her store because of a unfavorable Yelp review, told me I was evil and God would punish me.

The tanning beds are as sophisticated as the tanning beds at the professional salons.  The personal trainers and sales associates are all really cute as well.  I enjoy every personal training session I have with my trainer.  The only draw back are the membership fees and monthly charges, which is great for a gym of this caliber.

Need I say more?  \nI strongly advise anyone looking for a gym membership in the Cleveland area to stay far, far away from Urban Active.  Bally's and Fitworks might not be as flashy as Urban Active, but at least they won't rob you blind.\nMy 2 year membership was up with Urban Active in March of this year.  I went into the gym in April to sign the paperwork to cancel my membership and was treated horribly.  Even though I had every right to cancel my membership because my agreement was up, the meathead so-called manager that I was dealing with acted as if I was trying to scam them by cancelling..  After 20 minutes of questioning me on why I was cancelling, I was relieved to leave and be done with that place for good.  Little did I know I would have to deal with the idiots that work there several more times.\nIn July I was looking over my bank account statement and realized that Urban Active was still withdrawing membership fees from my account.  I called the Corporate line and they told me they never received any notice of my cancellation from the Crocker Park Urban Active.  I called the the gym and spoke to a manager to explain my situation.  Their response to my issue was that they don't keep a copy of the cancellation documents, they just send them on to Corporate.  And if something happens to the documents in the process, that isn't their fault.  I was livid.  I went back in to Urban Active to fill out cancellation documents AGAIN.  And guess what?  Somehow the paperwork got lost in the mail this time as well.  Imagine that.  So I went in to Urban Active for the THIRD time to sign cancellation documents and this time, they had the NERVE to charge me a $10 cancellation fee!  This time the documents miraculously reached the Corporate Office and my membership was cancelled.  But the best part is, they are charging me for 2 MORE MONTHS because they claim it is their right to do so.  So due to the errors of the idiots working at Urban Active, I will end up paying for over 6 months of a membership that was supposed to be cancelled in April.  I hope this review stops anyone thinking about joining this club.","useful":10,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Please note however, this is the first time buying a car for me; however, I did not feel too pressured.\n\nIt took a while to find this dealership because of the hidden location. On the outside the building looks a bit shady. The interior is not great either. Ben allowed me to take a test drive, but sat in the back. That was something I didn't quite like, but the positive side was throughout the entire ride he did not say anything to try to push for a sale. A carproof was provided and I looked at the entire car - all the while Ben did not try to hassle or tell me how \"great\" the car was. Even when I asked him to take the car to a mechanic, he simply said he had nothing to hide.\n\nI came back 2 days later and took it to a mechanic to inspect. Again, Ben locked his office door and hopped into the back of the car. I test drove the car again on the highway and then took it to a mechanic for pre-purchase inspection. The entire trip was about 5 hours and besides the end where Ben looked slightly pissed for being out so long and telling us that he has to get back to his office, there was very little talk from him. He let us choose the mechanic within a reasonable distance away from the dealership. I would say this experience was alright.\n\nAfter the pre-purchase inspection it was found that the car needed all 4 brakes replaced, and there was a small water pump leak. The brakes Ben agreed to replace all 4 with aftermarket brakes; however, he was not willing to admit the water pump leak and wanted to start a fight with the mechanic :P. Too bad the mechanic already left for the day.\n\nNow when we arrived back at the dealership we immediately sat down and talked about price. Now this is the part where it was a bit stingy as we went back and forth negotiating for the price. He was very firm about the prices. In the end I struck a deal for about $700 less than what was stated (Non-certified \/ \"As is\").\n\n In general the car is very clean for the price which a couple of mechanics have since told me that its a pretty good deal. \n\nOne thing I didn't like was that the car was not very clean (showroom clean) with crumbs in the ashtray compartment and dusty in the engine compartment. Ray, another sales person helped me clean the car engine a bit despite the fact that it wasn't him taking my sale. They did wash my car before me leaving, but the interior was still pretty dirty.\n\nOverall the experience was OK. Ben seemed a bit lazy, but at the same time I didn't feel too pressured to buy the car. He was very transparent about everything but when it comes to prices and amenities at the end its a bit tough to get what you want. The dealership is also ALRIGHT. It is tucked away, it looks sketchy but their lot is not that bad.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

In the foyer there's a hostess to direct you to either the bar (Bogey's) or seat you in the Onyx restaurant. \n\nI had the Aragosta di Salmone ($27). The description begins, \"Salmon and Lobster pair delectably well\" but the only lobster you get is in the bisque that drowns the entire salmon steak. The bisque was really good, but it was very tomato forward and not very lobster. Plus I really enjoy salmon and i like the fish to speak for itself. I think the dish would have been better off if the bisque were a a mist; not a waterfall. But that's just my personal take on how I like salmon. Doesn't mean the dish was bad. \n\nMy mom had the Pork Loin Chops ($20) and my bf had the Rib Eye ($27). \n\nThey also had Osso Bucco ($37) and Cioppino ($35). \n\nI'd give this place a higher rating if the prices were slightly lower. After a salad,  three entrees, two glasses of wine, and a desert, our bill was $109 before tip. \n\nThis place is kind of old Vegas. We went on a Wednesday night and there was a female lounge singer singing old Billie Holiday jams and such on a small stage in the corner. She had a great voice, but the setting was kind of inappropriate. I think if you're to have live entertainment in a low key restaurant, there should be more upholstery everywhere to dither out the sound. Otherwise, the sound is too direct. \n\nThe singer was a sweet heart, though. She interacted with the audience and half the crowd there seemed like locals. \n\nThey also had a free raffle for a gift certificate for Onyx. It's a nice gesture, but kind of corny for a place that serves salmon for $27. \n\nI thought the color palette of the decor was kind of schitzophrenic, too. \n\nThe ladies bathroom was huge, though. For a space you could fit two stalls and a sink in, it was a private bathroom. One john, one sink, and a chill out seat, all to yourself. \n\nThere's about twelve tables and booths and a bar. It's a pretty small space, but seems large because it's a perfect rectangle, unbroken up. There's also a bar that seats about eight. The place was at about 40% capacity when we went. Pretty good for a wine and dine joint on a Wednesday night. \n\nOur server was immensely patient, professional, and gracious. \n\nMy assessment in a nutshell is that I would go back if I didn't have to pay for it. The food was good, but beyond what I'd like to pay for that ambiance and meal.\n\n#offthestrip #noncasino","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I have also gotten my eyebrows done here a couple of times when I am feeling the need to be extra polished, and as another reviewer stated, they do a great job and for only $10.  \n\nLocated in the shopping center with Trader Joe's, this tiny place has been there for many years and is a great fit for what I want - I want to sit quietly for about an hour while getting my nails done (quite honestly when I do them myself, my toe nails generally look like I cut them with pliers).  I usually get a full pedicure along with a manicure with no color (I do paperwork all day long, and with color, I end up with streaks of red paint all over everything, I also keep my nails very short).  The entire process (my toes are drying while I get my hands done), usually takes about 45 minutes.  There aren't the perks of a higher priced salon, but a mani and pedi is $35 - which is perfect!  All of the technicians are friendly, helpful and efficient.  \n\nAs a warning, with Trader Joe's right next door, parking can be a bit of a pain during busy Saturdays.  The parking spaces for the shopping center are also oddly sized, so I usually swing around back to the spillover parking so I can get in and out of my SUV.  \n\nThey do appointments but also take walk-ins.  They do let you tip with your credit card (I think?), but I usually bring cash for that.  Grab a coffee from Starbucks or frozen yogurt from FroYo and sit back and enjoy a little pampering.

Nothing has changed on the vehicle weight wise and now the vehicle shimmies really bad after 60 mph.

He checked the whole suspension to include the shocks to make sure that was the issue and sent me on my way. The other day I had to purchase truck tires for another one of my vehicles through discount so I had them check the tires as well and they said the same thing.....\n\nI finally got some free time in my work schedule so I brought this particular vehicle over to mil amore & explained the problem to the owner. Basically, he came up with every excuse in the book why he would not take care of it. Even after I said I'm willing to prove that the shocks aren't an issue and rotating the tires to the back won't help the issue he still told me that even if I prove that the tires are the issue he still won't take them back because some BS about the manufacturers won't do anything for him. \n\nSo basically, the manufacturer's warranty is BS, his warranty as a business in the state of Arizona is BS & he will sell the wrong tires to anyone just to make a profit and he doesn't care about his quality, integrity or honor.

Service, Essen und Lokal top - obwohl wir erst sehr spät kamen, gab es überhaupt kein Murren oder Knurren - außer in unseren Mägen ;-)\nBedienung\nUnser Kellner war sehr kompetent und aufmerksam. Er strahlte Sicherheit und Ruhe aus - genau das, was man sucht, wenn man abends gemütlich essen geht.\nDas Essen\nWir hatten einen gemischten Salat vorweg und dann einmal die Pizza Siciliana und einmal die Spaghetti Parmigiano (aus dem Käseleib).Die Spaghetti wurden frisch auf einem Servierwagen am Tisch im Käseleib geschwenkt, die Pizza kam zeitgleich.\nBeides war heiß, frisch und sehr lecker.\nDas Ambiente\nIm Restaurant fühlt man sich sehr wohl. Pflanztröge und eine gute Anordnung der Tische lässt das Restaurant nicht so groß erscheinen, wie es tatsächlich ist. Dadurch entsteht eine gemütliche Athmosphäre.\nSauberkeit\nAlle Bereiche, die wir gesehen haben, waren sehr sauber.

Die Lokalität befindet sich bei den Sportstätten am Rande von Schmiden Richtung Stuttgart-Neugereut. Parkplätze sind in ausreichender Zahl vorhanden. Eigentlich hatten wir Lust auf eine tolle Pizza aber es sollte anders kommen. Nach dem Eintritt in die sauberen und gepflegten Gasträume wurden wir sogleich vom Servicepersonal empfangen und an einen freien Tisch geleitet. Nach kurzem Studium der sehr ordentlich aussehenden Speisekarte erkundigte sich der flinke und sehr freundliche Ober nach unseren Wünschen. Dabei gab er uns eine \"Tagesempfehlung\" bekannt, die nicht auf der Speisekarte aufgeführt war: Gemischter Fischteller mit Gemüse und Kartoffeln zu je 19,50 €. Unseren ursprünglichen Pizzawunsch vertagten wir auf einen späteren Besuch und bestellten die Fischteller. Dazu zwei Gläser Rotwein \"Primitivo\" der vom österreichischen Zinfandel abstammt und hauptsächlich im italienischen Apulien angebaut wird, erfreulicher Weise serviert in 0,25 L Gläsern und 1 cm über dem Eichstrich eingeschenkt für je 5,50 €. Eine Flasche Mineralwasser 3,50 € und zum Ende zwei Espresso je 1,70 €.\nDas Restaurant war mittlerweile zu 60 % gefüllt. Nach einer angenehmen Wartezeit von ca. 20 Minuten wurde das Essen serviert. Der Fischteller war sehr schön und appetitlich angerichtet (siehe Foto oben). Er bestand aus je einem kross gebratenen Stück Schwertfisch, Zander und Wolfsbarsch die geschmacklich sehr gut gewürzt waren. Der gemahlene schwarze Pfeffer auf dem Fisch gab diesem noch eine besondere Note. In der Mitte trohnte noch eine Garnele, die ebenfalls sehr gut geschmeckt hat. Kartoffeln und Gemüse harmonierten gut mit dem Fisch. Der Wein war erwartungsgemäß gut, ebenso Mineralwasser und Espresso. \nFazit: Ein rundum gelungener Mittag in einem empfehlenswerten italienischen Restaurant für moderate 57 €uro. Wir gehen da jedenfalls noch öfters mal hin.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The owner (I believe), Dr. Cindie Law is one of the sweetest people out there.  They were always very nice and knowledgeable and caring, and their prices were decent, especially considering the groomers are all students, so I expect them to be less than a professional grooming facility.  My dogs never looked the way I expected them to though, although they were always clean and happy (and that's the important part, really.)  They used to be $25 for a full groom, so after a $10 tip for each dog, $70 a month for my dogs' grooms seemed reasonable.\n\nBut then they got this new woman, I don't know if she's a student of employee, but she was RUDE and incredibly condescending toward my dogs...and toward me.  If you go there and you see a blonde with star tattoos, don't walk, RUN!  That woman is the last person who has the personality or temperment to work with animals.  I ended up complaining about her after two seperate incidences with her.\n\nThe last straw was when I referred yet another friend to them and called for pricing because her dog is much bigger than mine.  I was told the same price that I'd been paying for my two.  Well, after they were done and it came time to pay, I found out my friend's dog just got a bath, and my two (who got a full groom) cost $15 more each.  It would have been nice if they'd told me before, especially considering I'd been going there for every month for years and referred several of their clients to them.\n\nI now take my guys to Just Like Home Doggie Hotel and Grooming...and they are BEYOND fabulous!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

I took my maltese\/ shiba inu 7 month old puppy in for a cut and wash. When i got there the lady hands me my dog and i had to remind her she was missing her collar. As she gets it i notice they did a HORRIBLE job on cutting my dog. There were long patches and short patches EVERYWHERE! I cant believe they would even give me my dog looking like this. I asked the lady why there were patches and she replies, \" it because she has thick hair and thin hair in places.\" Im not a brain surgeon but looking at her hair i can clearly see its cut short because they cut it short and its long in some areas because its not cut at all. They were also suppose to trim the face but you can see long hairs everywhere.. just uneven by alot all over.\n I then ask the lady if she can go over it again and if it would have been easier to use clippers cause they said they use scissors. She replies that clippers would make it look uneven.... so why do they sell clippers on the shelves i wonder to myself..... S\n So she takes the dog back and after a few minutes i pop my head around the corner to see whats going on and there is the lady using clippers after she just told me it would make it uneven...... hmmm... She then see me and feels obligated to explain why she is using them now. I then hear her tell the other girl she has no idea why she didnt think of this in the first place.. hmmm....... So she gets done, hands me my dog who hair is still uneven.....(her headhair and her body hair being different lengths even though they are not suppose to be) So i can see they have no clue on what they are doing so i pay and walk out. I then realized to myself that they just cut her hair again so there are now hair pieces all over my shirt and all over my car from the ride home.. So in all i paid for a cut and a wash and got back and very apparent uneven dog who really needed a wash again because of the cut hair all over her from her touch up..

Servers passed by us as we stood at the door and the bartender (who we also assume is the owner) waved us to an open table, where we waited to get menus. We ordered two burgers and pasta for the little guy. It took more than 30 minutes to get our meal and my husband's burger was not prepared as described (or having experienced it at other locations).\n\nSince this is the second disappointing experience, it was clear to us what is wrong with this restaurant. The kitchen is clearly mismanaged and cannot handle being busy. Food quality is inconsistent, even when ordering a simple burger. Tip: do not order the steak.\n\nIn addition, it seems to be poorly run as there is no rhyme or reason to how people are seated and served (a table that arrived well after us received their appetizers and we were waiting on our only order).\n\nWe have had good experiences at other Shoeless Joe's and want badly for this location to thrive on a difficult strip of Eglinton but their kitchen needs to step up.

Naively, I decided to stop in and get a chance to reminisce. mistake. BIG MISTAKE. When I walked in, I was taken aback by a strange odor. It smelled musty or just like the place had not been aired out completely. I was greeted by the girl behind the counter, however, when I walked up to the counter I noticed that most of the veggies and toppings looked like they had been sitting out all day. The lettuce had a slight brown color and the tomatoes were completely limp. The green peppers looked like they may have been sitting out for at least two days. \n\nThis mistake is on me because I could have easily walked right out when I saw the toppings but I figured I was already in there so I may as well see it all the way through. I only ordered a regular size turkey & provolone sub which came to $5.57 (with tax). Unsurprisingly, the sub tasted stale and was a complete waste of my money. \n\nIf you do find yourself in the area, continue driving down N.Tryon for another minute.

The Winneburger (truck edition) is a delightfully sharp attempt to serve american classics (cheeseburgers, in particular) without relying on going overboard with size and toppings.

And yet it's one of the quickest food truck eats; a perfect lead-up before you reach for something adventurous. It's everything you want out of a burger fest with half the work.\n\nThe flip-side, of course, is that if you want to be filled you'll want two.

We drove 30 minutes to be told first it was cash only, but they could bill my insurance for lab work...(?) But like I said, we literally were 8 minutes late when they had nobody else in the lobby and had all these openings, she then tells us we can't be seen that day and we have to reschedule. So we did took a chance and rescheduled for for the next day, and the same brunette girl wrote on the card that our appointment was at 9:30 a.m. I called the morning of our appointment which was the next day to ask if they take credit and debit and double checked the time of the appointment and she told me it was 9:15 a.m. So she purposely put on our card that it was 9:30 when it was 9:15 and if I had not called we would have not been able to have been seen and had the same problem we had the first day. Strictly for comparison purposes- I've worked in detoxes in Arizona and they aren't the best but they help people who want it, and when I worked in Malibu at the number 1 detox and rehab in the nation, we never turned anyone down who needed or wanted help and never would have treated them like this. No matter who they were. So beware of the lady who works in the front and is in charge of the appointments because she is one of the rudest, most unprofessional people I have seen in this field and if you want help and are trying to get it then I suggest that you literally double check your appointment as well as call several times otherwise they will do the same exact thing they did to us. She also explicitly stated that certain patients, based on why they are there, are treated differently and are on more of a strict time schedule. It's definitely not the front desk lady's job to judge why I'm at ANY doctor, as she makes minimum wage and has no medical training. I was here on behalf of my girlfriend and I really hope people read this and see it- because if they are wanting help and trying to get help then I feel they should be treated very nice and with the upmost respect, not to mention the level of professionalism they should have at this office. \nHowever, the nurse and Doctor, when we finally saw them, were spectacular and very professional and helpful.

Since the space isn't very large, I'd recommend making a reservation. The restaurant is located in a converted home and I loved its warm yet cozy atmosphere.\n\nWhat we ordered:\n\nFritto Misto del Giorno  - House made mostarda & pickled cherry peppers sott'olio ($16). To be honest, simply reading the menu, I had no idea what this dish was. After quickly searching it up on Google, we discovered its translation was \"fried mixed day.\" Fried? Sold. This turned out to be a great starter - great for sharing! \n\nGrilled Ionian Octopus - Braised chickpeas, crispy onions & pancetta brodo. I thought the octopus itself was just okay (but I have to admit, I'm not a huge fan of octopus in general). I also found the chickpeas to be a tad undercooked as they were still quite hard.\n\nNduja Sausage & Little Neck Clams - Ouzo & shallot brodo with crispy polenta ($16). The portion of this wasn't very large as it came with only five or six clams. However, they were well cooked and the sauce, which contained bits of minced sausage, had a bit of a kick to it and tasted quite nice. My favourite part of this dish was the crispy polenta, which actually came in the form of a polenta stick. I don't normally love polenta, but if it was always served this way, I'd enjoy it a lot more. \n\nSquid Ink Tortelloni with Lobster - Mascarpone, heirloom carrot & brown butter sauce ($28). The highlight of my evening. The portion wasn't very large, but the filling sure made up up for it.. The filling contained large chunks of lobster and the mascarpone filling with the brown butter sauce was incredible. \n\nPerth Farms Berkshire Pork - Grilled shoulder chop & confit belly with caramelized cauliflower ($29). Amazing. Perfectly cooked pork and a large piece of rich pork belly. Simply delicious. My only complaint was that the caramelized cauliflower was really oversalted.\n\nA great Italian restaurant in the Yorkville area - highly recommended!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The dining room, tucked in century-old home, was small but elegantly homey. Our reservation was for 8:30 pm, and by this time, there was only one other occupied table in the restaurant that was already on the dessert course. We were both quite surprised about the emptiness given that it was a Friday night.\n\nSoon after placing our orders, we were served two types of bread with olive oil- focaccia with fennel seeds and some sort of sourdough, I can't remember exactly. The focaccia was particularly excellent. It had an incredibly spongy texture, almost reminiscent of a sponge cake. It was so dense and satisfying, and the fennel seeds added such a lovely dimension.\n\nWinter caesar salad ($14)- garlic sautéed kale, white anchovy, bacon, focaccia and cauliflower purée. I missed the usual crunch and lightness of the romaine lettuce. In comparison, the kale felt quite damp and heavy. The components that I did enjoy were the focaccia and cauliflower purée. But other than that, I didn't care for the salad.\n\nFior di latte mozzarella arancini ($15)- caramelized onions, aged balsamic and mustard seeds. They were delightfully crispy on the outside and hot and gooey on the inside. I also loved the pairing with the tangy balsamic and mustard seeds, and I wanted more of that.    \n\nFritto misto del giorno ($16)- the daily selection of fresh fried seafood and vegetables included calamari, oyster, and zucchini, with black olive tapenade and fresh lemon. I wasn't a great fan of the olive dip, but everything was so fresh and tasty that a squeeze of lemon was sufficient. My favourite component was (surprisingly) the fried zucchini!\n\nRoasted 'sous vide' chicken ($25)-house made mostarda, potato purée and farm fresh egg yolk. The chicken was incredibly tender and juicy. There's nothing I hate more than dry and overcooked chicken, and in this case, the meat was cooked to perfection and the doneness was uniform throughout. On top of that, the potato purée was absolutely scrumptious. I have nothing but praise for this dish!\n\nApple pie cannoli ($10)-cinnamon mascarpone, candied pecans, apple caramel. I've never really liked cannoli all that much, but this version definitely won over me. The cinnamon mascarpone filling and the apple caramel really brought out flavours reminiscent of the apple pie, but the usual rich buttery crust is replaced by the fried pastry roll. I really enjoyed this refreshing take on a traditional dessert.\n\nDark chocolate smores torte ($10)- white chocolate crackers, honey marshmallow, and dark chocolate sauce. It was also visually stunning, and I couldn't wait to dig into it. I personally preferred my apple pie cannoli, though the smores torte was undeniably delicious as well. On the whole, I thought both desserts were fantastic!\n\nWith the exception of the salad, the meal was truly wonderful! My favourites were the \"sous vide\" chicken and the apple pie cannoli. But I still couldn't understand why the restaurant was so empty on a Friday night. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed the meal, and I look forward to checking out their sister restaurant l'unità.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

I went for a swim in the indoor heated(perfectly) pool... and watched the snow out of the big windows along the side of the pool area.  I swam every day and then relaxed in the hot tub as well.  It was nice, and smart to have an indoor heated pool in a place like OHIO... Thanks!! \n\nThe parking is ok in the summer\/spring\/fall months... but there is NO parking close enough to a door in 20 degree snow flying everywhere weather.....\n\nThey do have the standard free breakfast.. and they mini convenience store for you late night snacking...   there is a soup shop and a sub shop both pretty close to the hotel ( within walking distance on a NICE day)....","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

This place opened up a few months ago on Freeport Rd., next to the harmarville \"fun\" center (bowling alley, laser tag, etc.).  Im glad it's here instead of the eye sore that was the closed down Eat n Park'.  I've been here twice most recently this past Friday for lunch.  I've only been here when it's empty, so it seems either I eat lunch too late, they do most biz' at night or I will be referring to this as the place that used to be 3 amigos. I believe it has one sister restaurant.  The space itself is set up very much like the Eat n Park used to be except for the addition of a bar close to the front entrance on the right as you walk in.  The bar is pretty big with about a dozen chairs and a few hi-tops.  There are also a couple plasmas, but overall this is not a place I would go to for cocktails or to hang out.  The service of the bartender has been very friendly and prompt both times.  The chips and salsa are free when you order the food and the chips have always still been hot right out of the fryer.  They could use a few more salsa options as I found the flavor of what I tried to be dull.  They have really good lunch specials with a \"pick one, pick two, and a pick three\" for 5.95 to 7.95.  The \"picks\" are the usual assortment of mexican fare (tacos, burritos, chalupas, etc.).  I've only tried the burritos and tacos and found them to be above average, especially for the price.  The tacos and burritos are piled high with cheese and meat (chicken, steak, ground meat, etc) and come with a large portion of fried beans (bland) and rice (dry).  Overall this is a good place to grab a good inexpensive lunch with a beer or two.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

She warns me it's a pretty big plate. \n\nI know what I'm about woman.\n\nAsks us to seat ourselves and the food will come, so we opted for the open terrace as it was a nice day. We chatted and the food came within 10 minutes. \n\nAcross the board the service was notably good.\n\nSo how's the food? The poutine was heavenly. Probably the best I've found off Montreal island for a long long time. The poutine hit all 3 targets it should. The fries were perfect. The curds were extra squeaky and generously spread. And most importantly, the gravy was amazing, the texture was something I really appreciated.\n\nAll this for a mere $8. This poutine was pretty much one of the biggest plates I've seen. This probably would have cost at least $12-13 if it was on the island of Montreal with a line-up outside the door (like the over-hyped Banquise).\n\nAll in all, I'm a fan for life.

He clearly wasn't listening to a word I was saying cos I said I wanted my side fringe trimmed and he cut in a full fringe... really short!! Also its not the same length on both sides.  So i got a wonky hair cut and a really short fringe. Not a good cut at all and extremely over priced for the service you get. Not even a head massage or a proper blowdry.

Et puis aussi, il faut noter une chose importante, il ne s'agit pas d'une piscine mais d'un complexe, donc beaucoup plus grand et avec beaucoup plus d'activités (de quoi occuper les jeunes et les moins jeunes...) : le complexe comprend un bassin à plongeon, un bassin avec des couloirs de nage et enfin une piscine récréative avec une pente douce qui est idéale pour les jeunes enfants. Il y a en outre une aire de jeux aquatiques, des trampolines, des parasols et un snack. Le coût d'entrée reste raisonnable: au plus cher 5$ pour un adulte seul ne bénéficiant d'aucune réduction (voir le détail sur leur site web)\nAllez, je noterai deux petits détails que je trouve quand même un peu pénibles. Dans l'enceinte de la piscine, il n'y a qu'un seul et unique endroit où vous avez le droit de manger : le snack. Ça peut être des choses ramenées de l'extérieur, mais vous devez les consommer à l'endroit indiqué. Ensuite, si vous êtes motorisés, sachez qu'il y a bien un stationnement mais cher. Si vous vous voulez économiser, pensez plutôt au métro qui est juste à côté.\n\nNB: il s'agit d'une piscine extérieure, ouverte du 7 mai au 11 septembre avec des horaires variables selon le moment de la saison.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Cake was arranged through their custom cake maker.  A half sheet of  cake for $50 and it was a well made and delicious cake too.  The good news for me is that I'm still enjoying the leftovers.\n\nBack to Toy Town.  So it's a kids play place basically.  Set up like a small town.  Each little house in the place is a different business.  Police Dept, Pizza place.  Hospital and so on.  We had 20 kids and as many adults at our party.  All the kids enjoyed it, from our 1 year old to the 7 year olds.  The girls were playing dress up with the clothing from the different houses.  There is a small bounce house in the back that everyone liked.  As per their standard party set up, we ordered Dominoes pizza from right next door.  This ensured that everyone got as much food as we needed.  We had a great time.\n\nThe kids all played with all of the toys in the place, we all ate pizze and then cake and everyone enjoyed themselves.  the staff here is wonderful.  They work to make sure that everything is smooth for you.  they handled the few things that we didn't think of and the party was a great success.

They talked us into purchasing a Guardsman warranty and was told that if anything was ever accidentally spelt on the leather it would be cleaned and restored for the 1st 5 years.  Basically we thought we had full protection for 5 years on anything that may go wrong.  Well, 2 years later we had all sorts of problems.  We sent design source pictures of all the problems.  Some mechanical. but mostly seams that split. and the stuffing where our elbows rested was showing very deep dips as we were told would not happen\n\nAll the sudden, nothing was covered.

We called Guardsman, as their warranted stated the seems were covered as well as any stains. but they advised that they would not cover the seems or bother to work on the leather stains in any way, period.  They couldn't tell us what they did cover.  Apparently nothing.  It was just a way for sellers of furniture to make more money.\n\nToday the repair gentleman showed up and advised the would put on new covers on the elbow rest and repair the minor mechanical problems for $350.00. No new stuffing would be involved or was provided.  Also, he would not fix the seems and said if they did get fixed they would just do it again.  Something about body oils at the seems where the real leather meets the vinyl.  So we told him to forget it. We would have paid him the $350 and more if he could have returned it to look new but he said that wouldn't even be attempted.  \n\nI suggest you don't buy anything from this store.

My fiance had purchased the ring at Gordon's in Delaware which is a partner company with Zales.  He paid the extra money and chose the credit card in order to get the best possible warranty for the ring.  The ring sizing was included in this; he paid for the engraving.  After about a week, he was called to get the ring.  He saw the engraving but I was not with him so we could not measure the size (although we learned later they could have used a ring sizer (the stick with the sizes in which you can slide the ring down and see the circumference).  He brought it home and I was ecstatic to have it back only to be let down again because it wasn't sized.  \n\nWe went back to the store together the following day.  The associate slid the ring down the sizer and low and behold, the size has not been changed.  The company must keep it another week.  I go again to pick it up and it fits!  The engraving now is, of course, all stretched out but still legible.  I hope to never have to deal with them again until my six month check-up as per the agreement of the warranty.\n\nFour months go by and the band of my ring has a sizable crack in it.  That's right: after all that, the ring they resized (or, rather, sent out to be resized) has broken where it has been welded together.\n\nMy fiance calls the store and tells them what happened.  The associate who picks up answers, \"There's nothing we can do.\" and HANGS UP ON HIM before he can say he has a warranty.  He calls again and explains that he has the warranty.  The associate tells him to come in; my fiance asks if he needs paperwork to which the associate says he does not so off we go.\n\nThe minute we step into the store and find someone to help us, she asks if we have the paperwork.  We explain what happened earlier and she tells us she cannot help us without the paperwork.  SERIOUSLY?!  So now we are fuming.  Then she tells us that the warranty doesn't cover a break in the band anyway.  We have to call Gordon's to get them to talk to this associate to get everything cleared up.  After being there for about an hour and finally getting my ring into the envelope to get sent away, she reminds us that the engraving will have to be done again- at a cost to us.

I told them they should make it authentic next time. The hummos you can buy in manufactured packages are usually dry and untasty, and we went there mainly for authentic hummos. Quite nice people.\n\nyou can watch TV (they had a football game going when we ate there) and my 7-yr old son loves food from other countries; they have the option of getting fries on the side, in case kids eat there (or adults who don't want rice, even).  the salad was excellent","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Elegant, organized store that was eye catching. As we walked in they had hundreds of anklets to choose from in ever size imaginable. Both silver, gold and multi colored beads. \n\nThe couple that owns the store were originally from Chicago and they were very pleasant. All of a sudden as I am checking everything out I see my sister sitting with the owner and a huge roll out cabinet and she is trying toe ring's on my sister. \n\nToe ring's that are custom fit for your cute little toesies. How cool is that? I have never seen them before. Every size, every design that you can imagine. Sterling silver or real gold and even diamond toe rings that were gorgeous! We both just had to get some. The cool thing is they are individual rings and they price them out based on usually three rings and you wear them together. Rope designs, diamond cut, smooth, etc... so much of a selection to choose from. \n\nMy sister purchased a set and so did I. They are very comfortable, will not slide off, you can not even feel them, including when your toes are mashed in your high heels. Then I liked them so much I bought the matching thumb rings. I adore thumb rings but they are never comfortable. \n\nMy sister said they were a bit high on prices, especially for the diamonds but I am happy with my purchase. They write down your size and can order on line and they will ship to you if you want to add more bands. \n\nNice store, friendly service. Keep in mind they will not work with you on price. My sister inquired about purchasing two sets and getting a discount but they would not take anything off. They basically lost a sale for like $5, so to each their own. \n\nCheck this place out for some cool toe rings, thumb ring's or anklets.","useful":8,"funny":3,"cool":6,"type":"review"}

During that time I purchased a new Mercedes and from time to time have been told by the company that does the occasional detailing,  that the car wash must be using dirty water as there are light brush marks on the paint.  They never seemed like a big issue and I am not so fastidious about my car to switch to another car wash. However,  today they have really caused some damage.  In an attempt to remove something during the pre-machine wash stage,   one of their handwashers must have had a stone in his brush and scratches to the paint are so deep in two places (and 5\" wide) that it will require professional attention and expense.  Accidents happen and I can accept that. However,  within 5 minutes of leaving the carwash I saw the damage and immediately (car still dripping water) I returned to the car wash to show the fellow (the guy who has worked there for 38 years) what had happened.  Given I am a regular,  I would actually have expected a bit of concern.  Before I could barely get the words out of my mouth what had happened,  he threw his hands in the air to say \"didn't happen here\".  Well, given that I don't go to any other car wash and they are clearly marks made in the very circular motion I'd just witnessed the handwashing guy doing,   there is no question they did the damage.   So my advice,  unless you drive a beater and really don't care about your car,  avoid this company.    I can accept that accidents do happen and that the brush might have picked up a stone.  But be professional and own up to the error and offer to fix it - don't treat a 20 year customer with such disrespect.  That is the last car wash they will do for me.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I have always wanted to try it for years now and finally I said to myself its now or never. I chose Dulak Pilates because of its well known reputation in town as having the best instructors and a wonderful studio. \nKelly is a stellar instructor. There isnt enough adjectives to describe how marvelous she is. She pushes me out of my comfort zone and believe I can do more than I thought I could. My body and mind is changing for the better. After just a few sessions with Kelly, I began to trust in her guidance completely. I feel exhilarated by the challenges in every session. Kelly is a body reader. She has the ability to sense if my muscles is working or not. If it doesn't (sometimes due to me not working hard enough) she would find ways to modify the exercise so I can feel the muscles Im supposed to be working on. She would often modify the exercise to fit my petite frame or my strained neck muscles. I learn to not short change myself and just tell her if I don't feel the mind-body connection working. I also learn that I better do it right and not cheat so she doesnt make me redo them (ahem the hug, the one hundred, the teasers, the elephant, the obliques twist and reach). Im pretty sure they will never get easier. Pilates always have a way to make one feel very humble. After a session a week with Kelly, I feel everything! every small intrinsic muscles has been fine tuned (my triceps, biceps, the abs to the obliques to the inner thighs and the glutes to even the back of the legs). \nI drive an hour once a week to Dulak Pilates Center to take my lesson. I might hate the drive but I have never ever regret a pilates session with Kelly.  I walk out of the studio glad that I came, glad I gave it my all and glad that Kelly is my instructor who help me to strengthen not only my powerhouse but also my mental toughness. When I thought I couldn't hold my power house or squeeze my inner thighs any longer, Kelly would tell me to do it one more time. \nThank you Kelly for teaching me that my body and mind are limitless and that I am capable of exceeding my own limit. Thank you for educating me about the biomechanics of human movement, and the importance of taking care of the body especially the core, the spine and all the joints. \nThank you Kelly for your patience with me and for your passion for teaching. I recommend taking classes from Dulak Pilates Center because of their high quality instructors. I can attest that not only Kelly has a comprehensive educational training but she has also put in countless hours and energy to become a competent qualified teacher. Pilates is all about the integration and coordination of mind, body and spirit. Try it for yourself! You will fall in love with it like I did! The studio is running an offer for Saturday morning reformer classes for only $30 per class!!!. My only regret is that I wish I had taken Pilates sooner when I used to live in town!

Then, we jumped right into the best part, beer tasting. \n\nWe were offered their nine current beers. Fox Tail Gluten-Free Pale Ale (similar to a cider, light, but not sweet with a hint of hops; decent for a GF beer!), American Lager, Weize Guy Hefenweizen, Citra Rye Pale Ale, Hop Box Imperial IPA, J.J. Pro AM Foreign Extra Stout (Limited), Red Fox Russian Imperial Stout Dark Ale, Baby J's German Chocolate Cake Milk Stout (Limited), and 5th Anniversary Barrel Aged Smoked Wee Heavy Scotch Ale (Limited). Alcohol content ranged from 5-14%.\n\nEveryone was really awesome and they were very generous with the tasting portions, inviting us to whatever was left over if we pleased.

The Croque was served with string french fries that had just enough golden crunch and just enough softness to rival McD's...\n\nI had the salad(can't remember what it was called), with seasoned, toasted walnuts and rich crumbled bleu cheese...John told us the walnuts were rolled in cayenne pepper and rosemary, and let me tell you--I'm a sucker for flavored walnuts in salad, be they with spices or with sugar, so I LOVED it...the salad came drizzled in a champagne vinagrette that paired nicely with Jamie's wine: the to-die-for Rosa Regale Banfi Sparkling Red...that wine was SO good that I've bought it from Whole Foods 3 times since visiting Jug...it's rich and thick(not syrupy, just not barely-existent, like most sparkling wines)...and it tastes like rose petals and strawberries :)\n\nalso, during the meal, John brought out a special he had created--2 juicy steak medallions drizzled in honey balsalmic--Jamie's reaction was \"That could be the only sauce I'd eat with steak, besides A1\"...it was lovely...\n\nanyway, definitely going back there, monthly, for their wine-tasting Thursday nights, as recommended by the chef :)","useful":2,"funny":2,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

However, the place is good enough that it deserves to be reviewed on it's own. Just keep in mind, I didn't eat there. But I did see the food. And I'm SO going back for the food.\n\nI chanced into here based on a quick iPhone Yelp search for \"wine\". I'd actually been looking for a wine store, so it goes to show you how much I'd read. Upon arrival, my friend and I decided that even if we couldn't buy a bottle to depart with, the atmosphere was pleasant enough to stick around for. You know, for a glass of wine.\n\nWe sit at the nice dark wood bar and the bartender sweeps over. My friend was undecided on her choice and, on my suggestion, asked the bartender.\n\nThis was the best choice made that day. By anyone. Anywhere.\n\nThe somo....somma.....sumal.....wine guy asked her about her tastes and preferences (red, non-specific) and gave her a few tastes. A bit more conversation and he recommends going for the \"Discovery\" flight. This turns out to be a fantastic idea for her. A spectrum of red wine was put before her and she was left in a state of bliss.\n\nThe....wine guy turns to me and asks about my tastes (red zinfandels, the \"real\" ones, as I found out), but I'm open to trying new wines. He thinks on it for a second and mutters a few possibilities while he looks at the shelf of wine behind the bar. Inspiration strikes, and he pulls out a pinot noir. Strange, but I'll go along with it. It was the damnedest thing, but if it wasn't a pinot noir that has a lot of the earthy characters that I love in red zin.\n\nSo that was how the night went. By the time I left there, with the good-matured feeling that wine gives you, I had been thoughroughly educated in all sorts of things about wine.  I actually even found out that the winery that sells one of my favorite zins has \"sold out\". Sad, but always good to know.\n\nIn short: Go here now! Sit at the bar with your friend(s) and talk to the (asks Mr.Internet) sommelier! and enjoy some fantastic service and, of course, wine.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I went back and told the woman there, since it was fine before getting my screen fixed. Again, took about 45 minutes longer than stated. When she gave it back to me, the home button then didn't work. She fixed it, and I thought all was fine. She did these repairs for free, so I thought I was in the clear. \n\nWRONG. After 4 hours later, the phone started to glitch and do things on its own.

There are other tile stores in town that carry much of the same merchandise, and their staff was much more helpful at helping me find items in their stores that they thought would meet what I was looking for.  I had to aggressively engage the sales girl here twice during my visit just to get some attention.  If I had a couple weeks to wait for the other stores to order my tile, I would have saved about half and been treated better.  Mexican Tile & Stone had what I wanted in stock, so I paid full retail prices to get it.  Paying such a premium I mistakenly thought I'd get a premium product, but much of it had serious paint and\/or glazing defects requiring me to rifle through the supply in their warehouse to get tiles that didn't look significantly different from each other.  Before this last step, the sales girl had made sure to have me sign TWO waivers about these being hand-made tiles and that I should expect variations.  Variation is one thing, and in the QC world variation has an acceptable tolerance range. Many of the tiles they tried to send home with me were downright defective and unquestionably outside any range of acceptable variation.  There weren't enough of the \"good\" tiles for my project, so I took a few of the best of the bad and had my tile installer mix them in the project so they weren't so visible.  However, I notice them every time I look at it and it really bugs me I spent full retail for these tiles.

While this particular hotel is not the newest (room decor is a bit dated) overall it was a very good stay.\n\nOne very nice touch was the evening reception with beer, wine, soda and several appetizers - cheese and crackers, chips and salsa and meatballs.  A very nice way to start my evening shortly after my arrival.  I also used the hot tub which is also in a well maintained indoor pool area.  And, of course, the usual Holiday Inn Express breakfast was available at no additional charge.  The breakfast is good, featuring scrambled eggs, bacon, biscuits and gravy along with cereals, fruit, yogurt and more.  \n\nIn the room itself the bathroom was clean and well maintained with a counter top that was sufficient in size for my morning shave, etc.  The bed was comfortable and the pillows were good - one of the best nights of sleep I've had in some time.  \n\nOn the down side I did get a whiff of mold when I first turned on the AC.  I either got used to it or it dissapated after having been in operation for a while.  Also, the desk chair did not raise up high enough to make using my laptop comfortable.\n\nAll in all, a well executed Holiday Inn Express.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Not great channel selections (lots of public access!). Elliptical was nice.\n\nThe breakfast: was okay. The scrambled eggs looks pretty grey so I avoided. Offered cereal, milk, yogurt, apples, banana, pancakes, sausage, scrambled eggs, hot cinnamon rolls, juice, coffee. I tried their make your own pancake machine (you push a button) for the novelty of it. \n\nA decent value, but I would have been happier with a price around $90 rather than the $114 we paid (with taxes).","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The first person I spoke with about the bug issue said there was nothing that she could do.  In fixing the bug issue, the manager emphasized how important customer service was to him and that was the reason he offered me a room that had recently been sprayed for bugs.  The second problem is minor: I asked for a drink that I forgot to grab until I was finishing my breakfast.  The guy was literally locking the fridge when I realized I had nothing to drink.  He refused to unlock it because it was exactly 9:30am - company policy.  The guy seemed angry that I asked; I was surprised he said no.  Although I knew I could ask the manager - and he would just give me a drink - it was just too minor a request to seek out a manager.\n\nA place does not have good customer service if only a manager can make a decision.  The staff has to be empowered to fix problems and directed to give good customer service.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The manager I encountered tonight, Shaun, needs to go back to school on how to deal with customers. His condescending, demeaning, rude behavior is something for the record books. Hopefully the letter I just sent to Blockbuster will initiate quick action to avoid having Shaun offend too many other customers. And, thankfully, I don't let such encounters get to me...for long. \n\nAnother reason to avoid the store (assuming it stays open much longer) is that the DVDs in the Kids and Family section are almost all scratched and virtually impossible to watch without issues. Blockbuster needs a policy that encourages people to treat the DVDs with enough care that other people can enjoy the movie for months to come.\n\nI will follow up with the results of my letter to Blockbuster, where I asked that this person either be terminated or given a written warning that such antics will not be tolerated. Period. We'll see, but at least I know that Shaun takes his negative, sarcastic, condescending attitude with him and I never have to experience that level of negativity again.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I was able to get the price down to just over $200 after opting out of some glare shield or something on the lenses and begrudgingly paid almost 3 times the advertised price. \nHad I not needed new glasses so badly I would have gladly paid for the exam and went somewhere else. I'm still not exactly sure why the price jumped SO much but like I said, I needed the product and I had just spent over an hour and a half and was ready to get out of there at any cost (no pun intended). \nNext time I'm in the market, I'll definitely research a few options before considering going back to America's Best.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Here is what it does.  If you, the customer is late, on  an ever discriminatory water bill, even when your use is the same each month.  The Company will disconnect your water services.  We are talking, usually 10 days late.  Fair enough, strict policy, not common to Phoenix, Tempe, Chandler or Gilbert, but ok.\n\n However, it does not matter if it  disconnects your service in the morning, or in the afternoon.  If you immediately pay the balance (owed, which for a residential customer should be between $105.00 to $115.00 bill) and a $70.00 reconnect fee.  You have to weight for the water company to sometime, and often even past the permitted 24 hour time frame.  However, GW will advise you, if you pay an additional $35.00, they can turn the service on that same day, regardless of the time.\n\n The ACC requires GW to turn the water on at a reasonable time once disconnected.  We know that at all times is reasonable because GW can turn it on instantly if you pay $35.00 fee on top of the $70.00 fee.  Next, at one time, maybe just maybe GW had an excuse, but since their disconnect and activation is done remotely, meaning they can turn it on at a flip of the switch, just as they turn it off at the flip of a switch, not only is the $35.00 'blackmail' fee in appropriate.  The $70.00 reconnect fee is inappropriate.  Why, back in the day, yes a company may need a person to go out, turn the water value off, put a tag\/seal on it, and then undue all of it once restoration of services.  However, now that it is done remotely, it is a flip of the switch and the cost to do such, at best could not be in excess of $5.00.\n\n Now, the Maricopa City Counsel is fully aware of the historic, corrupt and abusive policies of GW, but does absolutely nothing to restrict their abuses when it can through City Ordinances.  Next, we are in a State where Private Sector is suppose to perform much better than public utilities.  However, my experience has shown that the above cities are much better at governing water policies.  The ACC recognizes that GW is one of the most disruptive water service providers in the State of Arizona, yet it does nothing either.

I said fine, I would pay cash, but then he still didn't want to go through the process of insurance denials then cash pay. He literally rushed me out of the room. The little information he did give me seemed only to get me to a surgeon or using more drugs (when my temporary issue is mild, not severe!). His information also contradicted other information given from previous doctors. When I asked to at least have my two recent MRIs read, he read them both right in the hallway!! as he was rushing me out. In perfect earshot of staff and other patients. I was stunned. Very unprofessional, rude, and a breach of patient-doctor confidentially. The receptionist was even rude. I won't be stepping foot into Specialized Pain Management ever again. Unfortunately now I have to go through the several week hassle of finding another place.

My primary care physician referred me to Dr. Batlan about 18 months ago after I experienced a debilitating episode while engaging in some heavy gardening around my home. I was barely able to ride in my car, even with my wife driving me and my primary care physician provided me with enough extra-strong pain killers to see me through until I could get into see Dr. Batlan (which was only a matter of a few days).\nDr. Batlan was extremely sympathetic, and prescribed a more effective pain medication while getting me scheduled for a series of MRIs, and getting me on the surgical schedule for epidural injections (I'm somewhat 'pill phobic' when it comes to long term medication).\nLong story short, the epidurals worked wonders, as did a 'use as needed' corset type back brace. \nI've continued to see Dr. Batlan as I've experienced periodic flare ups over the last 18 months, and have found him to be very helpful in directing me to specific physical therapy regimes I can use at home that have helped to significantly reduce my pain flare ups. Although I understand that my back isn't going to magically heal itself and that I may eventually require some type of interventional surgery, Dr. Batlan will continue to be my go-to doctor for this issue. Let me also commend his administrative and medical support staff for always treating me like an actual person rather than a number. \nIf you need a caring, technically astute physician to help you with a pain management issue, look no further.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I've only done a few Yelp reviews ever but since the owner of Xamusa insists I do one, here it is. I was happy with paying the advertised Craigslist price for their built in refrigerator but the condition and customer service from Xamusa was horrible. The frig was delivered with deep scratches inside and a broken drawer. A replacement drawer and touch up paint was promised but still not received after 3 months of asking for it. This refrigerator was advertised as like new condition with a full 6 month warranty and was assured it was in perfect condition both mechanically and cosmetically from the owner of the company. First week after delivery it leaked water ruining the hardwood flooring underneath and a few weeks later the compressor went out loosing all groceries.  After 2 1\/2 months of this refrigerator not working, repairs were done with used parts and the unit is still not working correctly. Just yesterday when I contacted the owner of Xamusa about the frig still not staying cool inside he told me the warranty was voided, this was the second time he has tried to void the warranty. He said not to call or contact him again and to call someone else for the repair leaving me high and dry. His claim to void the warranty this time he said was because I refused to pay the travel fee on the compressor warranty call, that's not what happened. I tried to pay with a credit card before the technician left but was told it was to late at night to call in the payment and the owner would call me the next day for it. The first time he tried to void my warranty was because I had not given a positive yelp review.  This was two weeks into the 6 month warranty and there were problems with the refrigerator already surfacing, not to mention he never said anything to me about giving a review, it was not in the ad with the warranty information or in writing, but I was told multiple times after that I had to give a positive yelp review. Seeing only three other yelp reviews in the Phx area confirms this is not a warranty requirement. There have been alot of problems with communication as in not  answering the phone or responding to written communication at times. The refrigerator has other issues that I'm willing to live with, I just needed it to keep food cold and frozen, but he tells me I'm being picky.

Elements of Japanese style like mon seals, brocade, daruma dolls, kimono printed glass and lattice walls made the space really exotic and atmospheric. \n\nWe sat at the bar, so I didn't have the full sit-down meal experience. I did do a tour around the restaurant first and saw the private dining room, the fancy Robata grill imported from Japan and the sushi chefs all lined up, knives gleaming, waiting for the dinner orders to start. Everything looked impeccable. \n\nThe cocktails are really different from the standard: I had a Gin-sing martini, which contained gin, ginseng, ginger and vanilla foam, garnished with edible flowers. Sounds weird but it was so good. Apparently the drink menu was devised by a Bar Chef bartender. I watched the bar staff create some very interesting mixes indeed:  the cocktails are each $14 but for once, I think the price suits the amount of innovation and effort involved. The highballs are served on a large globe of ice, which I haven't seen done anywhere outside of Japan. We also had shots of sake ($6 to $8) - I love my cold, milky Nigori! I think Ame is going to be a very good spot for a posh drink or two, even if not for a whole meal.\n\nThe food menu is not extensive. There are about five or six items in each of nine menu categories. Since we were just having a snack at the bar, I didn't try any of the entree-sized dishes. First, we had the scallop sashimi ($12). What we got was beautifully presented but it was not what was expected. The scallops were tossed in a sesame cream with wakame. I had been craving the cool cleanness of straight-up sashimi. So... the lesson here is that the sashimi dishes are not regular slices of fish on a plate - they are more complicated dishes which incorporate sashimi. Next, we tried the kabocha tempura ($10). It was served on a bed of nails and it was absolutely the best tempura I've ever had. \n\nI intend to get back to Ame soon to try the duck curry and the unagi ramen, along with a couple more of those unique cocktails.","useful":8,"funny":0,"cool":4,"type":"review"}

Dirty as hell floor and a too bright, uninviting dining area. Amy Joy's is 24 hours and seemingly the only donut shop in all of Cleveland that is so. The customer service, like the reviews on Yelp state, needs improvement. No one was at the counter when we walked in and when the girl did come out, she was less than friendly. She didn't encourage us to stay, in fact she seemed to be trying to hustle us out as quickly as possible. She had some kind of drama going on in the back, it seemed, possibly with a gentleman I caught a glimpse of. Shrug. She didn't know what donut I was eating and didn't care, she just wanted to take care of us quickly and return to the back. I commented and how the boxes were cute and she kinda rolled her eyes at me. This woman should not be in customer service. Lol.","useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Will be brief because we were on a mission so I didn't stick around to check everything out.  We didn't even ask for help but I guess that speaks volumes.  A) Canadian Tire is pretty set in it's layout.  I just walk in and kinda know where things are.  B) There are never really a lot of sales staff near the entrance to assist you, but I have to think there are customers walking in there who don't know their layout.  \n\nWe were beset though by Canadian Tire promo people, running a promo.  It involved a ticket where you input a bunch of info at one station of 10, only to then find out the game to \"win 5000 in Canadian tire $$\" was actually at another stand where they had only 3 stations.  I want to say its a scam to get your info but really, I should have seen it coming.  Got impatient and left the place before I got to the 3 station section...i'll never know if I would have won and now its just eating me up inside...so you lose some stars for that Canadian Tire!\n\nI had the conversation with the friend who's car needed to be boosted about whether being Canadian or having Canadian in their name, makes Canadians more prone to shop there...I'm of the opinion that it doesn't matter...they could change their name to tire, it wouldn't impact the majority of consumers.

It used to be good, very helpful staff.  I had an issue with the windshield wiper motor, fixed it, no issues.  My hood latch seized open, drove it in, they fixed it and showed me how to fix it myself for free.  However, the last year and a half, my family has had nothing but horrible service there.  \n\nMy husband got his brakes replaced, and continued having issues with them.  Took it in again a month afterwards, and the guy on the phone said that they were \"worn through already\" and that \"they would replace them for free.\"  Right.  More like they didn't even replace them in the first place.  Then once that was done, had more issues with brake noise.  Brings it in, the calipers are seized.  I am very surprised that brake work, and brakes can be replaced (apparently replaced twice) and the calipers cannot be inspected.  So, they were fixed.  Still has issues.  This time we bring it to another brake place, and apparently a special coating is supposed to be applied as a last step of a brake install, and this was not done.  This caused friction and noise.    Applied the coating, no issues since.  \n\nPrior to this experience, I also had my brakes done.  I noticed a burning smell after highway driving, and then I noticed that my back right tire hub cap was burning hot.  Brought it in, calipers seized.  Had to get them replaced.\n\nWe had not planned on using this garage again, however I took my car there to have the winter tires put on and an oil change.  They drove it in right away, said it wouldn't take too long.  2 1\/2 hours later, I go and check.  Still waiting on an oil change, but they say it will be not too long.

And Steeles Brampton Ontario. I will never recommend Canadian Tire again. I went in there for a simple service. And all I got was 1) attitude and wrong information by a cashier. Then when I was in auto service. It didn't get any better. 2) lack of knowledge of who was the correct person to help me with what I needed done. The person at the auto desk didn't acknowledge me. He wasn't able to assist more than one customer obviously but the least they should do is acknowledge you and give how a time frame of when they will get to you. 3)finally I was told I needed to go to servicing. Some big fat guy was on a personal call. Didn't even ask what I needed. So I went to the cashier in auto services and she was the only person  who got to the bottom of trying to help me. Even then she was confused as to why I was told to come to auto service dept. When all I needed was a bicycle repair. Making a customer wait unnecessarily and not giving correct information is a total waste of time. At the end of it all I didn't even get the service I needed. I came out so distressed with a poor experience of Canadian tire. This is why I would rather go to home Depot, Rona, Lowes etc.. No one ever knows what they're doing at Canadian Tire. I hate that I had to walk in there and waste 30min. I'll be sharing this in Twitter and Google. I would have loved to share a good experience but it seems that Canadian tire doesn't feel it's appropriate to invest in quality training for their employees. No one there knows what customer service means.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The restaurants are more about ambiance and being seen than it is for good food.\n\nDYNE on Avenue came across my radar when I had heard about the over-the-top Chef's Last Meal; a 34 oz. ribeye with not one, but two lobes of foie gras, butter-poached lobster and all the fixings for $325 which owner and executive chef Richard Andino tells me has fed as little as two and as many as six.\n\nThe ambiance is relaxing, intimate and makes for a romantic date night.  Sink into a plush velvet banquette while admiring the details of the décor (my favourite being the mirror above the bar which reflects the window and patio) of DYNE. The background music features a great list of throwback tunes from the 70s to 90s that will have you bopping in your chair while being just the right volume to still carry on conversation.  The private dining room upstairs in this Victorian-house converted restaurant can host up to 46.\n\nThe menu divides appetizers into hot\/cold and then leads into entrées listed by type of protein.  The food is spun-off from Portuguese and Spanish classics and often feature an infusion of Asian flavours. The wine list highlights Portugal\/Spain but you will find a few Ontario wines as well.  The cocktail list makes it hard for one to decide which to get as they all sound delicious!\n\nAndino, who is no stranger to the restaurant business (having started as a busser at the age of 19) and since worked his way up the ranks; all the way to executive chef at Mark McEwan's North 44.  In the kitchen is former Canoe sous-chef Julie Marteleira who shows that the kitchen is not just a man's world.\n\nDrawing from her Portuguese roots, she wows me with Sardines, served with egg, cherry gastrique, Serrano ham and chili-garlic rice.  The combo sounds seemingly strange on paper but you won't need any convincing once you've tasted it.  The slight sweetness and tartness of the cherries works really well with the saltiness of the Serrano.  The sardines are seared to a golden brown and the words \"fishy\" don't even cross your mind.\n\nThe Pan Con Tomate is one of the best I've had as the freshness of the Heirloom tomatoes and simplicity of buttered bread served with thin slices of Serrano makes it hard to resist not filling up on carbs before the mains arrive.\n\nThe Smoked Oysters with chicarrón are served with pickled daikon and vinaigrette and the mesquite, tart and sweet elements come together really well.\n\nFor mains, the Angus Beef Ribeye with Asian chimichurri, scallions, Romesco, fingerlings, oyster mushrooms and sweet corn gives me a taste of what to expect when I return with my posse to experience the Chef's Last Meal (which I am now even more convinced to do).  The steak is seared to a perfect medium rare and the sweetness of the corn cuts some of the richness inherent in a steak.\n\nOn the lighter side of things, the Swordfish with bacon, pearl onions, parsley and egg which draw inspiration from traditional Spanish\/Portuguese cod dishes.  The bacon added great flavour to the dish.\n\nDesserts feature items such as Pastel de Huevo; a sponge cake topped with almond cream which is a light way to end the evening.  The only dilemma we have is trying to scrape off every bit of the sponge cake without eating the parchment paper that it so stubbornly clings to.\n\n\nThe Torrija is also a favourite of mine; caramelized brioche with whipped cream and sweet milk.  At first glance, they look like pan seared scallops which gives me an idea for my next April Fool's Day menu!\n\nThe dream team that sees Andino as entertaining host and Marteleira as tummy pleaser is definitely a win in my books.  If you want to experience full-flavoured food and have a good time, then DYNE is the place to go.\n\n\"Ibericó ham is good, but when it costs $800 a leg and you have to charge for it...\" says Andino and when \"paying $40 for charcuterie and a glass of wine isn't Toronto,\" says Marteleira as we discuss why things like the famed Ibericó ham are not on the menu.    DYNE's philosophy is simply to cook good food and to make sure everyone has a good time.  At the end of our discussion we all agree - good food is good food.  You start with quality (not necessarily expensive) ingredients and it will do all the talking on the plate.\n\nTIP: There is currently a great Groupon promotion going on - 2 can dine for $59.

And the lobster, although it tastes good, there were only 4 very tiny pieces of lobster in the dish. The main dish we had lamb and swordfish. The Lamb was tasteless, like it was water boiled.

Awful experiences each time we have been to Pro Bikes in Monroeville \nFirst experiences were a few weeks ago. We were in the market to get a new bike for my fiancé.  We are just getting in to biking so we budgeted around 400 to 500.  We walked around the store amazed at the overpriced bikes and we were shocked at the minimal selection within our price range.\nWe finally got waited on ( they ignore you unless you are in the pricy bike area) and the salesperson was clearly irritated that we were not looking at bikes that would increase his commissions.  He used every up sell technique. We walked out irritated and drove to Southside, Thick Bikes. We ended up buying an 800 bike.  They listened to us and really cared that we purchased the right bike for our needs.  They provided great customer service. \nSame routine repeated a week or two later when we need a bike accessory for her bike ...Went to Pro Bikes and felt like the invisible guy..no service\n\nFinally.... The final straw that has driven me to write this review...  My older bike needed minor service to the pedal.  First there was a screw up and the older guy at the counter did not properly tag my bike.  I called to check on its status a few days later and I had to play 20 questions with the guy so he could figure out which bike was mine...to then order the part!   Picked up the bike and put it in the garage.   We went riding for the first time after the repair a week later. I guess we needed to do an inspection when we picked up the bike. \nI got on the bike to take a ride on the trail. The chain was off and the breaks were bent to the point that they did not work.   Popped the chain back on but still couldn't ride.   Somehow, my minor service requirement turned in to needing new breaks and other \"tune up\" work to be able to ride with my fiancé. It is now in a different shop for a week for repairs to the \"repairs\" from Pro Bike.  \nSave yourself time and stress... If you live in the east ... It is worth the drive to Southside...

I finally got a new-ish bike and Pro Bikes had it. It was one  of those finds that you had no idea you were even looking for. In other words, I had no intention on buying a bike, but I did.

You can hear people easily and yourself think.\nTaste: 0- I hope you are not here for taste, but if you are I won't judge. It's a bike shop!\nTouch: 8- I am a hands on shopper and that drives my wife nuts. But they let you touch and feel your way around trying out things.

This is not Pro Bikes fault, but his. He is looking for chrome spacers and they just are not in style right now. They did have a handful just not enough. The staff was kind, smiley and very helpful. Like many bike shops they too have a guy who will size you to a bike. What I liked about this place is that this guy goes on the decades of experience that he has and not technology. I'm not looking to ride in the Tour 'd France so why spend the money on an insane fitting. He asked plenty of questions in order to decide if the bike was right for me and if the fit was right. He made it a point to make it about me and the bike and not the stores profit. If it wasn't right, he might not have let me buy it. \n\nI like that they put the customer first. I give this 4 stars even though I may not go back. It is not because of them, but geography. I live to far away. However if you live closer to Monroeville please stop in.

So naturally, we are hungry after escaping the hipsters of Remedy we are down for some regular chill.\n\nWe seat ourselves outside to wait out some of the crowd and drink the remainder of our 6 pack of PBR cans [remember we had just come from hipster\/lawrenceville] when out of nowhere our simple pleasurable time is disturbed with the outbreak of a 10 person fight! [we got lucky because this is apparently unusual] -- there was even astonishment from the participants [\"REALLY? We are having a fight at the Sandwiche Shoppe????\" - yup pronounced that way]\n\nAnyways, there was much scramble to break up the fight and not stub out eyes with cigarette buds and the chefs did quite a job at driving the trouble makers away. Surprisingly, no cops came checking anything out just drove along liberty ave.\n\nNeedless to say this delayed our now greatly awaited sandwiches which we received for free in the process. [we tipped very well that night] The guy making our food brought us our food and engaged us in a friendly chat for about 15 minutes [much needed to restore his nerves].

Please observe a lengthy amount of his material to get the full effect of this review. This review is about my first-hand direct experience of Dr. Shaposhnikov and is regarding medical procedures and conditions.\n\nDr. Shaposhnikov is an Endoscopy specialist. His specialty includes Colonoscopy. I presented to Dr. Shaposhnikov with symptoms of diverticulitis and a health insurance membership card . After waiting over an hour passed my initial appointment time and paying hundreds of dollars as co-pay, I learned three things.\n1) Nobody in that office waiting room but me had insurance.\n2) Everybody was there to have a colonoscopy and I could hear everything about everyone else's symptoms and financial condition (or lack of insurance).\n3) I was being charged to pay for everyone else while waiting for everyone else to be seen before me.\n\nMy initial interview with Dr. Shaposhnikov was about 5 minutes. His accent was extreme and hard to understand, and you would imagine after repeating the same things from rote memory to every patient before me the doctor would have learned to improve his English-speaking ability. \n\nCha-ching: another several hundred dollars later and I meet Dr. Shaposhnikov in the hospital for the procedure. Again, I'm listening to everyone else around me about to undergo the same procedure by the same doctor and I learn three things... this time while in a hospital gown:\n\n1) Nobody in that hospital procedure waiting room but me had insurance.\n2) Everybody was there to have a colonoscopy and I could hear everything about everyone else's symptoms and financial condition (or lack of insurance).\n3) I was being charged to pay for everyone else while waiting for everyone else to be seen before me.\n\nWeeks after the procedure I get bills. And more bills. Cha-ching! Thousands upon thousands of dollars later... I still have no diagnosis of diverticulitis. I had to go to. Another. doctor. with a Better. accent. To get a . Real. Diagnosis. I guess Dr. Shaposhnikov , in his infinite experience. Had never seen. Or heard of. Diverticulitis.\n\nDr. Shaposhnikov gets 2-stars because he didn't. Kill. Me. \n\nMy advice to you: if you have no insurance, you'll love Dr. Shaposhnikov. Otherwise, get a different referral.","useful":6,"funny":4,"cool":3,"type":"review"}

Starbucks are all pretty consistent from one shop to another.  In my experience the only time I am unsatisfied is when I get a rookie preparing my Cup 'O Joe and they make it way too weak or way too strong. Starbucks puts out a good flavored product that I can't deny. This evening I ordered a grande Veranda for myself and tall gingerbread latte for my wife. \n\nStaff:  \nFriendly and helpful.  I needed to reload my Starbucks app and being a newbie to the Android platform on my Galaxy Note 4, I was fumbling around trying to access my account info. Thame gal behind the counter was more than patient with me and explained what I needed to do. She was quick at preparing my order for my wife and I. I noticed that she also greeted other customers and acknowledged their presence when they entered the store. \n\nCleanliness. \nFloors, chairs, tables, and counters are all kept clean. I displays are neatly organized with like products rounded together. Bathrooms are clean and stocked well. All the stainless steel behind the counter was polished and sparkling. \n\nOutside seating:\nTables and chairs looked to be clean and in organized manner as I walked by them coming in. \n\nAmbience:\nToday their was no music. I was kinda bummed as I look forward to listening to the indie music that is a staple to this chain of modern day urban coffee shops.  It helps to kinda wind down after a long and busy day while reflecting back. It kinda feels weird sitting here with only one other patron in the store who is working on her laptop and not having something to listen to.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

Maya, Sora etc found in Yelp) in Koreatown to compare the price and stuff like that. But at last I chose here based on my personal preference (would like a Korean-style haircut instead of a Japanese one), and maybe the relatively high number of waiting customers at GOA.\n- Just so you know that I am not a native speaker or a Korean; I am a pretty shy asian generally. Plus I don't quite care about how my hair looks like except they stole all my hair lol ! \n\nFirst Expression: (why they lost one star)\n- When me and my boyfriend walked into the salon, we saw a lot of customers sitting on the sofas waiting for a haircut! When we wanted to ask for the price list however we can find no one; every staff there were working hard on their job.\n- Finally! We waited for a chance to speak to one of them! (It depends though, since we were quite shy maybe so we started off like that haha) We booked an appointment and we went back after 2 hours.\nP.S. the stylist spoke English to us politely \n\nJorney begins: \n- Once I settled my coat at the \"hanger corner\" I followed my stylist to one of the chairs. \n- And we will discuss about how she could do for me: she asked me how much do I want to cut to (Just showed her) and do I want layers or no (Just say yes\/no)\n- Then I showed her a photo for how I would like to cut my bangs. (Basically it is \"see-through bang\" that is popular in Korea) She got it faster than I think (with just a glimpse of my provided photo!)\n- Suggestions: Like some of the Yelp reviews, I would also suggest bringing a photo with you to let your stylist know exactly what you want. Also in my opinion, it's not difficult to communicate with my stylist using simple yes and no english (unless you want complex style:( still you could show photos!!)\n- After that another male staff lead me to wash my hair first. Since I have seriously damaged hair that my hair tangled like a mess after the wash, they offered me another wash with a different shampoo. I think he did a better job than what I read in the Yelp reviews; he carefully put a towel over my eyes to avoid water spashing, and the water temperature was just warm enough. Even when my stylist (yes, both the male staff and female stylist washed my hair) used cold water for some reason, she would acknowledge me first before washing. (Note: she might say Korean, but you will know when you hear \"cold\" :))\n- Then my stylist started her job. I couldn't comment on anything about the process because I am not a professional, but at least I would like to say that the journey was enjoyable. I just let them to cut my hair as she wanted since I know once I decided to go into this salon this means that I have given all my confidence and trust to them. \n- At last, my stylist asked me what style do I want to finish the look: curl or straight.(Got it done and you're good to go!)\n\nSome comments:\n- Service \nService was actually great for me as well as my friend, except they won't chat with you a lot (but I am totally okay with this cos as I have said that I am quite shy) For those who want talkative stylists that will communicate well with you about how they treat your hair, or anything else, this salon might not be your choice if you are not Korean. From what I observed they all did treated Koreans or those who can speak korean well :) Second, good service because they also came and asked if we wanted some drinks:)\n\n- Quality\nSo at last they didn't steal all my hair for sure haha! So I am quite satisfied already since I have no expectations for my haircut that I just want a haircut. However, at a third-person perspective, my boyfriend actually told me that my hair looks exactly like the photo I showed the stylist! This surprised me too haha!\nFor the hair treatment, my hair actually became smoother immediately! The treatment just lasted for around half an hour. After that, my stylist even asked me to touch my hair to feel the improved, different texture! One last note: I will come back again when I need another treatment or just a haircut:)\nFor my boyfriend 's haircut, he is also satisfied with his except the fact that they didn't clean the hair left on his neck. That made him quite uncomfortable at that time. But in overall, his haircut was done quite fast like an hour with quality. (His stylist is the same as mine)\n\n- Price\nSince they have Christmas discount, my haircut(plus hair wash) and a hair treatment costs $100 in total.\n\nLastly I just want to suggest that if you would like to go to this salon and have a try, just tell your that you are a visitor in Korea! (So that it is not a must for them to speak English in their \"own country\") Try to feel their culture at another perspective maybe you might find something fantastic or interesting :)","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

She seemed to be the manager and told me I will be seen soon (although they were fully packed with other clients waiting).

I had a hole develop in some gently used shoes that were not yet five months old.  These were only worn walking around a cushy office building, so I was surprised when they developed the hole (never had another shoe do what these had) and even more surprised when I learned that FF thought I should go pound sand for thinking that their shoes should last a little longer than five months.\n\nThis review is more about the company's absurd and spineless return policy than it is this specific store, but this is the store where I purchased my shoes.

I ended up ordering their RS370 kit. Sam at EVOMS was very friendly and professional. The parts arrived on time although half the shipment came to my house when I asked for it to be shipped to my installer (the other half got to the installer). Luckily the exhaust and headers just fit in the car, so I was able to take it to the installer when I dropped the car off. I also ordered stainless steel exhaust tips with the setup but received black chrome ones instead. I can forgive this because the black chrome is beautiful, and after seeing it I decided to give them a go. All the parts were well packaged and arrived in great shape. I'll know by the end of the month how the kit transforms the car.

On 9\/1, I took my 11 year old maltese to see why she was losing so much weight. The first vet did a senior blood panel. On the 2nd, she left a message that had no sense of urgency with the results. When I called back, she told me Jazzy had diabetes, to start her on 1 unit of insulin (my third dog has been a diabetic for years so I knew what to do) and to bring her back in 7 days. But Jazzy wasn't eating so I gave her a half a unit so as not to drop her too low. The next day (the 3rd), she was not eating, drinking or getting up to greet me. I called and said I think it was time to put her down. I go in with her, thinking she's had diabetes for a lot longer than I thought and there was no option at this point. THAT is when the second vet I saw told me she had PANCREATITIS in addition to the diabetes AND a heart murmer! Why would the first vet not even tell me let alone tell me to rush her back in on Wednesday? Pancreatitis is very painful!!! \nNOW, we are dealing with early cataracts, cushings, diabetes, pancreatitis and a heart murmer but...the second vet says...it's possible she could recover well but tells me she'd support the decision to put her down. I was so incredibly torn and it was about the money. I only had about $2k left in savings and another dog at home who also has issues. I am left alone and when the vet comes back, I ask her much it would be to try and save her - she tells me $2200 - $2500. I am torn with what to do because I think I have to pay it THAT NIGHT. At no time, did this vet or any other person at the office tell me that they offered interest free payment plans for situations just as this. I found out when I called on 9\/14 asking if my lil' girl's remains were back and heard it when they stuck me on hold. When they came back on - they said, \"Oh, yes... they've been here.\" BEEN THERE? Why wasn't I called that they were back? And why wasn't I told I HAD AN OPTION...ESPECIALLY WHEN I ASKED THE VET STRAIGHT AWAY! I was under the impression I had to pay everything up front at that precise moment. After the move here and everything being so expensive in Arizona, I wasn't willing to deplete the savings account because I had a third dog at home. I even told her their older brother passed on 6\/11 from lung cancer after a year of battling it with chemo and I was not willing to lose another dog so soon! WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME? Why didn't you give me that option? I was absolutely willing to help her if it meant not depleting the savings account. I have a job - I could have paid it. I just didn't have it all THAT NIGHT when I thought I had to have it! HOW DARE YOU PUT ME IN THAT POSITION WHEN THERE WAS AN OPTION! I'm so sick of this new generation of incompetents. They just don't care. AT ALL. They all seem to think they can just make bad judgements and then just say sorry afterwards. IF YOU HAD GIVEN ME THAT OPTION and she didn't make it - At least I knew I tried. But you never gave me the option and I felt I had no choice. And then your office has the unmitigated gall not to even call me when her ashes were returned? I suppose I'm also to be a mind reader in addition to automatically knowing your policies and being a vet to know what she REALLY had? I have no words that can describe how utterly disgusted I am at those two vets and that practice overall. I am SICK TO MY STOMACH that I put my lil' girl down because no one told me the payment plan was an option. I said I wanted to talk to that vet. She has yet to call me. They wanted me to talk to the Office Manager. But the office manager wasn't available that night and didn't see me holding on to my lil' girl thinking I had no other option but to put her down and the office manager didn't race in to save the day. IT WAS UP TO THAT VET TO TELL ME WHEN SHE SAW ME SO DISTRAUGHT WITH THAT CHOICE. I haven't stopped crying since last night! That vet KNEW I was torn and that it was all over the money. She should have and could have said something...she chose not too. She didn't say, \"It's about $2k to $2500 but if it'll help, we have an interest free payment plan\" because if she did.... I WOULD NOT HAVE PUT MY LIL GIRL DOWN. Honestly - there are no good vets in Arizona. They all seem to think it rather a lax profession where mistakes are tolerated and apparently even encouraged.\nI honestly hope you two vets and every employee present that night all experience the heartbreak and remorse I now have to live with for the rest of my life and I hope it haunts you as bad. SO MAKE SURE IF YOU, AS A PET OWNER, GO THERE... YOU INITIATE THE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT OPTIONS BECAUSE THEY AREN'T GOING TO TELL YOU ANYTHING and make sure you have them fax you results so you can see what your dog really has because they won't tell you that either.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

I give 3 stars because it's hit or miss on how my visit goes depending on who is working.  I do take advantage of the DD Perks program.  I typically get the Iced Lattes and enjoy that they have specials they run.  Last week the espresso machine wasn't working so I received an Iced Coffee.  I am ok with this since I enjoy these as well.  Unfortunately this morning I felt overcharged because although the store states their promotion is over with Iced Coffees ($1.49), if you purchase your iced coffee on-the-go through your DD Perks ap it's still only $1.49 instead of $2.09.  That's a big difference.  I did call in to let someone know but to be honest they seemed to busy to honestly care that I got a small coffee instead of a medium.  I have started coming inside in the morning because the drive-up lines tend to get long.  As someone that frequents their store weekly I'd suggest having the friendly people at the cash register (they sometimes have a lady that doesn't seem to have any personality, low energy and talks very quietly, not what you'd expect to be greeted with at 6am).  Why not throw the funny guy in the mix that talks about thankfully we made it to Friday or the young lady that is always up beat and personable.

This is especially true for our past experiences with plumbers...\n\nImagine my complete and utter amazement to find an honest, dependable, knowledgeable and all around great plumber: Jerry!! I cannot sing his praises loud enough!!\nWhen my kitchen sink clogged (badly) I turned to Yelp after Angie's List dealt me a real dud the last time I needed help. Jerry came out exactly when he said he would (his first thumbs up in my book) , quoted me a price and then spent hour after hour tackling the problem. With each passing minute my anxiety rose as high as I imagined the bill would be. Turns out the clog wasn't just a clog anymore but a collapsed pipe. Jerry explained that he could pinpoint the location with a camera and maybe then get a snake in to fix the problem but he'd have to come out the next day. I reached for my checkbook (and the Tums) but Jerry stopped me, refusing payment. He further astounded me by saying IF I wanted him to come back and IF it turned out to be the bigger problem - a collapsed pipe - the next day's camera work would be included in that repair - IF I decided to let him fix it. Wow! He patiently explained worst\/best case scenarios and prices, answered my many questions and gracefully eased my anxiety. \n\nLong story short, it most definitely was a collapsed pipe, right in the middle of my kitchen floor; getting to it involved a saw, a jackhammer and shovels. Jerry and his partner, Danny, worked all day, put in extra effort to make sure that there were no hidden problems and left the area where the hole was dug cleaner than they found it. Three day's work and a price that was unbelievably reasonable. Jerry, I think I love you... :)\n\nIf you need a plumber, look no further. Seriously. Why gamble when we Sin City homeowners finally have a sure thing?","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

With leather booths, dark tiled walls, and a wide bar at the back, it's likely you're in for a comfortable meal.\n\nAside from the market priced meat, everything on the menu is $22 or less and divided under three sections as small\/medium\/large plates.\n\nSMALL PLATES\nThe potted duck (a duck rillette) and the steak tartare, while perfectly fine, weren't especially notable. They are, however, extremely well-priced at $6 and $8, respectively.\n\nMEDIUM PLATES\nThe chorizo corndog - a surprisingly interesting and tasty snack. With pickled onions, egg, and pummery, it's a little spicy with its ground chorizo interior and a a bit crunchy from it's crunchy exterior. A decent-sized snack.\n\nThe hot-smoked trout cakes - three pea pancakes topped with trout and creme fraiche. They were okay, but not a re-order. A serviceable canape.\n\nTheir crispy wings are smoked and fried and come with a house BBQ sauce of consisting of Sirracha and ranch. Really excellent wings - the meat was moist and tender, and even with the saucy sweet and spicy exterior, the skin still retained a bit of crunch from the fryer. Would order these again and almost made me order the fried chicken because of how good they were. But... there was more food coming.\n\nI was very excited to try their tourtiere hand pies and I was not disappointed. A mix of pork and wild boar in a tallow lattice crust and sided with a tomato-cranberry relish. Definitely something to re-order. Quite enjoyed the flavours and the flakiness of the pie pastry.\n\nLARGE PLATES\nThey had a house-made pappardelle with \"cheeky\" ragu on menu and of course, I had to order it. While good, I felt like it wasn't as strong as the other large plates that we ordered. Thought the pasta would go awesome with the stew instead.\n\nMy absolute favourite of the night was the Huntsman stew: braised short rib, venison, and pie dough crackers on the side. Such great and deep meaty flavours, as well as that lovely collagen-thick texture of the stew. A great and hearty winter meal that really needed a beautifully crusty white bread to sop it all up. Still, we made do with the spoon after the crackers were gone.\n\nA surprise for me (though why after the wings) was the fish & chips. A lovely and light tempura batter surrounding a moist and flaky cod. So nicely flavoured and perfectly textured, I didn't even dip into the remoulade sauce! Sided with so-so salt & vinegar fries. Which I mostly ignored in favour of the fish, anyway.\n\nDESSERT\nA very tiny dessert menu: apple pie, lemon tart, and a cheese plate.\n\nThe apple pie was a fried pie reminiscent of the old-school McDonald's treat of yore. Nice, crispy, a little heavy, of good apple taste. Just not my thing.\n\nThe lemon tart was much more my speed and much less a tart than expected. A low jar of lemon cream that was just a shade grainy (though nothing that would impede me from eating it) and with a very nice mellow lemon flavour. This was accompanied by two rather tasty butter (shortbread?) cookies.  I quite enjoyed this one but almost felt that I should have gone for the fried chicken instead.\n\nThey've just opened and are working out some process kinks - so be prepared for a slightly drawn out meal - but this is most certainly worth a visit. A great mid-priced restaurant that's serving up some excellently executed dishes. Overall, this is a definite recommend from me.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":4,"type":"review"}

The decor, the beautiful light fixtures above the bar, the warm wood and low lighting was very welcoming. As you would imagine, a place called the Huntsman was full of...you guessed it...bearded hipsters. Not that that's a bad thing but it was the crowd if you were wondering.\n\nMy BFF and I sat at the bar and drank some wine - not the greatest list but they said they were out of the first two we tried to order because they were changing their list so hopefully when I go back there will be more depth to the selection. We weren't crazy about the bottle we did get but we drank it all the same. We finished up with Jamesons so we made it work!\n\nSo I loved being here and wanted to give this more stars but as a vegetarian looking at a very small menu, there was very little to eat. There was a white bean and kale stew but it didn't interest me. I tried the fish and chips as I eat some fish and really had no other choice. But first I started with a ricotta, roasted tomato and grape green salad with pecans that was pretty bland. The fish and chips was also bland. The tempura batter was ok but there was very little taste to the fish and I was disappointed with the salt and vinegar thin cut fries. My BFF had steak frites and her fries were delicious so if I'm back I'll definitely order the regular fries. She also got this delicious home made ketchup that they had served with her appetizer (corn chorizo dog that she loved) and they gave me regular old Heinz. My BFF liked her steak and corn dogs so perhaps this just isn't the place for a vegetarian. Yes, I see the name is Hunstman and I'm not surprised, but it doesn't account for me being disappointed with not just the choices I had but the actual food. Bland on both courses with mediocre wine.\n\nThat said I just loved being there and am sure I'll be back to try again. Here's hoping the wine list improves and the menu changes with the seasons.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I have eaten at most every location in Western Pennsylvania, including Erie, and even State College.\nThis was my first visit to \"Lakeside,\" and I must say I was completely blown away by the decorative efforts that make this place feel like the inside of a Dia De Los Muertas Holiday Greeting Card . . . Skeletons everywhere . . . I LOVE IT.  There are lots of skeletons in the other, newer Mad Mex locations too, but this one was the most excellent yet, including the skeletons in the Men's room (assuming the same for the Ladies too), and the bar area had the Mexican rendition of Tarot cards painted on the walls . . . Excellente!!\n\nNow, however, the food.  I usually try and eat at least one \"Gobblerito\" each season, sometime between Halloween and Thanksgiving.  It is a limited edition burrito stuffed with all the fixens' of a traditional Thanksgiving dinner, and even has cranberries on the side.  \n\nWhen my burrito arrived, it didn't have that usual \"snappiness\" of a traditional Mad Mex burrito, it looked loose and flabby.  And when I tasted it, I almost felt like this turkey was left-over from last year's Thanksgiving feast.  It honestly didn't taste fresh, and unfortunately, I believe my burrito was prepared in a microwave, as the first bites were luke warm, but when I stuck a bite into my mouth from the center, it actually burnt the inside of my mouth so bad . . . I wanted to spit it out, but there was a table of women sitting right across from me, and I didn't want to ruin their meal by spitting out food across my table . . . so I held it in, and received third-degree burns in the roof of my mouth.  So glad I had ordered the frozen Pumpkin-Apple margarita (which was very tasty by the way) which helped to alleviate the pain, but sitting here writing this the next day, my mouth is still suffering and I can feel the skin molting inside my mouth.\n\nService was a bit slow, for my liking.  I had already known what I wanted to eat when I walked in the door, and I told the hostess I didn't need a menu, but she gave me one anyway.  My actual server took her time getting around to see me, and I was actually feeling a bit hangry when she finally did come over to take my order.   Thankfully the food arrived in a timely manner, but it is a shame that the food didn't meet my expectations.\n\nOverall, I give this place a 5 for ambience, the decorations, and the wonderful view overlooking the lake, but I have to subtract points for the food, so I'm gonna split the difference and go 3 out of 5.  \n\nI will be back to give them another chance, just because I like the location so much, and I also happened to receive a postcard in the mail just yesterday for a free burrito to help celebrate Mad Mex's 23rd (WOW, have I been eating this food for 23 years?) Anniversary from November 27th - December 8th.  Ole'","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The Muay Thai class is for all levels.\n\nPrior to this gym I checked out another gym down the street. The classes were much larger and focused more on fitness drills.

I believe (not 100% sure) but it could be the original.  Anyways, this place has changed my life.  The first time I had it was 13 years ago, I was 13 yrs old and in junior high (Hendrix Jr. High stand up!!).  My buddies and I would save our lunch money and come here after school.  A good friend of mine asked me if I like guacamole....ignorant to what it was I replied \"no.\"  Little did I know that this \"guac\" would change my palate forever. \n\n I started off by eating carne asada.  steak, guacamole, pico de gallo, cheese in a giant, light tortilla. what's not to like?\n\nThen I moved on to the Arizona Burrito.  steak, potatoes, cheese and pico de gallo.  Again, what's not to like?\n\nI was later introduced to the Steak, Egg and Cheese burrito; really good, but now I always ask for this with potatoes.  Which would make it the ultimate breakfast burrito that you could eat anytime of the day.\n\nwhenever I need to switch things up, I'll order the chile relleno or the fish burrito.  I know, I know, fish burrito in AZ?  But trust me, the fish is fried to perfection and is really delicious.\n\nIf they opened up a fancy sit down restaurant and served their dishes on plates and bowls, they could easily be the best Mexican restaurants in the valley.  I kid you not, I'm a Mexican food connoisseur.  I've lived in the southwest for over 20 years and I grew up with my latino brothers.  I got this...  Other than the carne asada here, the next best would be El Pollo Supremo in Tempe (another Yelp, another day).  \n\nSince moving to Honolulu, I've been feeling so deprived of Mexican food.

The store was easy to find and the staff was friendly, communicated clearly with one another and therefore knew exactly who I was and what I needed, rang me up and I was out of there in 5 minutes tops.

I've collected coins since I was 8 years old and had a pretty good idea of what the market would be for this particular collection.  After a quick phone call to C&C to determine their level of interest, I was invited to the shop to let them examine my coins and price them out.  We set up a time and day that was mutually acceptable.  The shop was closed on this day of the week to allow staff to work up their inventory and other duties, so we had complete privacy during the transaction\n\nI dealt mostly with one of the owners, Ken Moon.  Ken was very open about pricing and grading and we had a pleasant morning discussing a broad range of topics, some of which was actually about the value of the collection I was wanting to sell.  Subject to examining the sets, Ken made me an offer that I felt was more than fair, and we closed the deal on a handshake.  They examined the items, confirmed grading, and there was no backtracking on price. He cut me a check and the transaction was concluded.  Simple as that.\n\nTo be honest, when I walked into the shop, I expected the usual \"beat down\" on price that dealers usually try to get the price down.  That didn't happen.  Ken showed me the spot prices, made adjustments for the numismatic value, and quoted me an offering price.  It was fair and there was no haggling.  \n\nI highly recommend C&C Coin and Stamp.  I don't usually bother to write up these kind of reviews.  But due to the high level of professionalism and unexpected transparency of the process, I wanted others to know they can deal with these guys in confidence.  \n\nDoug L\n11-19-15","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

I got a pretty good deal imho as I changed my package a bit & will get 4 change of outfits :D 2 bridal gowns, 1 evening gown & 1 traditional Chinese outfit. I also liked the quality of their photos & backdrops (i prefer indoor photos... yes it fake but it's awesome lol). Honestly... the best place to do this sort of thing woudl be in taiwan. Sadly,there is nothing in the same league in Toronto. But it's good enough unless you want to fly to Asia.\n\nI will have my photoshoot soon  & will see how they are :D But so far it's been a great experience. The gowns they carry are San Patrick, jasmine, Private label by G, Ella Rosa, etc. \n\nThey have other packages too where you can rent an evening gown, bridal gown & traditional Chinese outfit for $1000 or so. Again, this will most likely benefit an asian bride as there are usually a few dress changes during the reception, tea ceremony, etc. I believe they said they would rent bridal gowns for $ 600. Amour also takes photos on your wedding day. I think the photographer is good. However, I am finicky & prefer to have photos in a photojournalistic manner & they don't really do that sort of thing. If you don't care and only like point and shoot this is the way to go.","useful":4,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

I went with friends on a Saturday night, we made reservations, but it didn't seem grossly overcrowded when we got there at 7. The drinks were really cool, and they seemed to have a decent beer selection as well. I got the 1\/2 lb of brisket, and I was so happy I did. They give you buns and toppings to make sandwiches and there was enough for me to take home which is always a treat. The mac and cheese was great! \n\nI will say that the service was a little disappointing. The waitress we had was very nice, but didn't really tell us too much about the menu. I thought this was odd, considering this is a new restaurant so it should have been a safe assumption we may not have been there before. As I said I got the brisket, but I didn't know it would be coming with topping and sides to make a sandwich. It was a pleasant surprise for sure, but should it have been a surprise? There are sauces on each table, but we were never told what any of them were.\n\nI'm hoping they work out those kinks as the time passes, because this is a great new spot.

Ayant fait l'objet d'une chronique à Salut Bonjour (TVA), ce lieu de la dent sucrée, pour les nostalgiques qui voudraient encore trouver des bonbons comme autrefois, apparaît comme un retour dans le temps, littéralement ! Dès que vous y mettez les pieds, vous découvez un décors complètement rétro qui vous fait revivre tous vos plus anciens souvenirs de sucreries enfantines. Attention, vous en prendrez une habitude, c'est certain ! Ne soyez pas surpris si vous décidez de repartir avec un échantillon de tous les bonbons qui vous intéresse, c'est tout à fait normal. La propriétaire prend un soin extrême à retrouver le plus de bonbons et de gommes chez des fabricants encore en fonction, souvent américains ou britanniques, puisque c'est encore eux qui les fabriquent. Je ne vous direz pas quels bonbons précisément vous y trouverez, vous devez passer y mettre les pieds car ça vaut vraiment le détour. J'en suis moi-même resorti TRÈS HEUREUX d'avoir pu mettre la main sur quelques délicieuses reliques.\n\nNe vous fiez aucunement à Google Maps, ni à aucun GPS, car ils vous induiront en erreur.

Once you're in, you'll discover a retro deco taking you back into childhood. Caution, you'll get hooked, for sure ! Don't be surprised if you leave hands full of candies, it's logical. The owner takes great care in finding all the old products and gums, you used to love. She finds them at american and british manufacturers, and maybe more. They are usually the only ones still making those candies. I won't tell you wich particular treasure to look for, in the store, you have to go and see for yourself. I was VERY HAPPY when I came out of the store with my delicious find.\n\nDo not follow any Google Maps or GPS indications, you'll end up in the wrong place.

Even the McSalad is better. Salad here is prepared like the pre-made bagged salad you can pick up at Smith's next to the vegetable section! Chicken was far from crispy. \n- Onion rings were a bit too flaky. When dipped in ketchup, the batter would fall off leaving only  onion between my fingers, an oily onion. \n- Oreo shake was thick and creamery throughout the last drop. Good recommendation. Although, I still think the Carl's Jr Oreo shake is a bit better bc it taste the same, but cheaper. \n- No ready napkins. No small container for sauces.

We get there about 130 PM prior to going to seeing the new mike judge movie. We enter and head towards the bar.  It is very muggy inside of this place, how they manage that I just don't know.  It's a relatively mild humidity day outside and feels like a costa rican airport inside.  There also is an off putting smell to the place that is a cross between some kind of industrial cleaner and something else I can't quite place..maybe the smell of broken dreams...  The bartender is so obviously uninterested and apathetic that you can feel the contempt he obviously has for the customers and the disappointment in where he finds himself.  I ask for a guinness and they don't have one nor do they suggest a suitable alternative.  Annie gets a pretty awful vodka\/tonic and I settle on a shiraz,,,maybe the worst glass of wine I've ever had in a restaurant.  It was just gross.  Annie orders a pizza, which truthfully was edible.  I mean it was cheese, marinara and soggy crust.  I had the hot tapas steak and fries,,,which took close to an hour to receive with no apology.

Sold On Charlotte Properties (who handled our lease and property) recommended Mae's Carpet Cleaning.\n\nI called and talked to Juan on the phone. He is a super nice guy. We discussed thoroughly my situation. He deals with Sold On all the time and their properties. We talked about the fact it's a townhome, I have a dog (so a pet deodorizer would be needed), how there is carpet in 3 bedrooms and two stair cases. He says with the $25 coupon.... $134. Okay, let's do this.\n\nFlash forward to carpet cleaning day 5 days later. Juan walks in and says oh I didn't realize it was a townhome. What? He says... that'll bring the cost down a little. Oh, okay... yay! Then he says.... oh you have a dog. We need a deodorizer. Oh, there's three bedrooms and two staircases. \n\nUm, we just went through all of this on the phone a few days ago. Okay, whatever. He's a busy man. Maybe just a mixup. \n\nJuan says okay you're new total is..... $162 with the coupon. I'm no math major, but I'm pretty sure that's more than $134.

I very rarely leave negative reviews, but this was just unacceptable. I wish I would've had more time to call around and price businesses.

But this shop is better than just a cloth diaper store (although it's great at that). It's a fantastic full-service baby boutique, catering to the crunchy side of the mama (or should I say maman?) spectrum, but very all-encompassing and welcoming. They probably won't even look at you funny if you mention formula feeding or your scheduled c-section. Probably.\n\nThey have a fantastic selection of baby carriers\/wraps and offer instructions on using them, which is an awesome resource to have available, considering how babywearing-friendly Montreal seems to be. Great to have information on hand in a friendly setting. They also have toys and teethers and all sorts of other natural and baby-friendly things.\n\nWhat sent me into Bummis, though, was a case of seriously stinky diapers. I cloth diaper my kid, but soon after moving to Montreal, a formerly unnoticeable diaper pail suddenly had a nasty ammonia reek. Maybe it was the water, maybe it was the kid, maybe the detergent, maybe the different washing machine, maybe the diapers. All I knew was it had to go, and I couldn't change the kid or the water, didn't want to buy all new diapers or a new washing machine, but could stand buying fancy detergent if it would fix my problem. So I looked up online, learned about Rockin' Green, and saw that Bummis stocked it. \n\nI went in and spoke with one woman, who quickly turned me over to someone else with more funky diaper expertise. This second woman was amazing. She helped me troubleshoot my problem, suggested that no, I likely didn't need to buy a $30 bottle of detergent, but should try the $3 sample first. Maybe I just needed to use more detergent. She even gave me a free water test strip, to see if my water was hard as I suspected (it was). \n\nI felt bad, because I would have happily given them the larger sale, but I'm so glad that their sage advice fixed my stinky diaper problem, for cheap!

He is truly a master of his craft. \n\nAs an added bonus, he had his daughter, Teresa Joy accompanying him with her Violin. Not only is she a master of that, but she has chimes with cowbells and a small cymbal. As her father plays the lead instrumentals she plays the lyrics. I never new a guitar and a violin would sound so good together.\n\nRomeo and Juliet, Besame Mucho, And I Love Her, and Love Me Tender were some of the classics they played. Until I heard these two artists play these songs, I have found a whole new appreciation for this style of music. To their credit, from beginning to end, they did not take one single break except for in between songs.\n\nOverall, if you are planning to bring your significant other to this, I would say it is a perfect date night type of situation.

Andrea was attentive and listened to what I wanted. Nothing crazy, just a trim and some bangs and root touch up. She applied the color and let is process for 30 minutes. After washing and drying my hair, she noticed that the color didn't take to my stubborn grays. I didn't notice it right away so I appreciate that she didn't try to hide it.

Gavin is fantastic and I am never using another garage again now I have found them!\n\n\n It is so hard finding a garage you can trust. My car is now 8 years old and in my last MOT all I needed was two tyres and a windscreen washer pump. Every time I've taken it to another garage they always seemed to come up with things that needed doing, and as I am not a mechanic myself I don't have a clue!\n\n\n Gavin takes pride in his work and does little extra bits and bobs for you, for example he cleaned my light up so water didn't build up in it and filled up my windscreen wash. He is also always happy to discuss with you what needs done and show you in a way that isn't patronising.\n\n\n I would definitely recommend this garage to anyone. It is also really handy as you can walk around morningside when your cars being done and Loopy Lornas is nearby so you can go and eat their amazing cakes whilst waiting for your car (always a winner).","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

When booking in for this year's MOT, the guy asked if we were fed up with the rattle and did we want it sorted - being cheap and not being bothered by it we said not to bother, but he just fixed it anyway with no charge.\n\nShortly after last year's MOT, The Man took a speedbump too fast and knocked something loose under the car.

It's about 100 metres down this road.  Parking under the TTC bridge.  I had some trouble finding it when the address read 21 Old Mills.  There wasn't a clear sign so it's easy to miss.\n\nKayaking instructions were basic.  Just how to paddle and turn.  They didn't tell us what to do if we flip over or anything.  Although we had life-jackets and the water was shallow at many places, like 1 foot deep.\n\nThe review on 2\/12\/2015 mentioned foot pedals.  I don't know what those are.  There was just some feet rest.  Nobody mentioned anything about those in the orientation.  Somebody did help with the push off into the water and dragging us back in after the trip.  He also helped carried down and back up the hill that led to the water.  So I guess service has improved significantly.  \n\nWe only paddled down to the bridges at Lakeshore.  You can't paddle North.  I remember from hiking last year that there are dams up there.  There are 4 bridges at Lakeshore and we only got to the second before going back.  The waves were getting high.  That's the recommended trip from the starting point to close to Lakeshore.  The alternative is paddling around the marshes.  One or the other.  You still get to see swans, storks, ducks, Canada geese and coromonts.\n\nGood exercise.  They had 3 different types of paddles and I picked the middle one.  Upper back was sore the day after.  The others worked the core or the arms more.\n\nWe were slightly late but no one mentioned it.  And we had our allocated time.\n\nGuides were friendly and helpful.

When I pointed it out when I returned the kayak, the staff person just shrugged and said \"yeah, some people kick them too hard\" - then returned the boat to where it could be used by later renters without looking at it or trying to fix it. I don't think this poor equipment maintenance was an isolated incident, either. There was a group getting into a canoe at the put-in point, and one of the seats broke when the canoeist sat on it. \n\nThe Humber itself is a great place to paddle.

So I met my wife there.  They could have used someone with an eye for design, as the decor could be classified as thrift-store-restaurant-chic.\n\nWe started out with a hummus appetizer, which also came with kalamata olives, salted pickles, pepperchinis and shug (which is something new I've never had, a mixture of olive oil, cilantro, garlic and chili flake ground together).  The shug was fabulous!  The hummus was tasty, albeit a little chunky.  I prefer a smoother puree.\n\nMy wife ordered the shwarma\/gyro combo, while I went with the shwarma plate with 2 side falafel.  The lunch combos came with an Israeli salad, which never arrived at our table.  Hmmm.\n\nMy wife found the chicken shwarma and gyro meat to be overcooked and dry.  She also though either the chicken or the mayo-based garlic sauce drizzled over it tasted funny.\n\nI got used to the garlic sauce after a couple of bites, and cleaned my plate.  The falafel looked almost like little muffins, and were pretty good.\n\nWe ordered the baklava.  How to describe it in one word?  Dry.  They must have found this bad boy in the Gobi Desert.  Baklava is supposed to be moist with a honey simple syrup, which they must have been short of.\n\nI had to temper my first reaction, which was to call out the kitchen staff and have each of them take a bite while berating them, a-la Gordon Ramsey.  I love that Hell's Kitchen.\n\nThe owner visited our table, and was very welcoming, very friendly.

To be more specific they serve chicken. We chose the chicken.\n\nI noticed the seating area contained two TV's not an extensive selection of sports to choose from as they advertised, but at least two and a half men was on so I felt I was \"WINNING\".\n\nThe tea dispenser was unusual, as it contained sweet and un-sweet tea.  You push a button to select your choice, however the teas tasted of an instant type of concentrated tea, which was not  good at all.  Off to the nice Coca-Cola fountain drink machine located beside it.  The ice was cold, fresh and when added to the Coca-Cola it was very refreshing.\n\nThe meals we chose were: Chicken Tenders, and the Chicken Wings ( I have added a picture of both meals) I was unfamiliar with Garlic bread sticks with the chicken wings, but they were hot, fresh, and drenched in butter.  They were good, but again, with chicken wings? \n\nIt would be nice if they had a wider menu selection, beside chicken, however it is nothin' but FRICK\"N Chicken.\n\nI wish these folks well in the chicken business, but because of the limited menu items, and the oddity of the bread-sticks, the prices are too high to maintain a viable business........prove me wrong, but I assure you, this place will be gone by December 2011. \n\nNCFoodGuy","useful":1,"funny":4,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

Where the hell do I begin?\n\nWe signed a 6 month lease (THANK GOODNESS). Our first day in, our apartment was filthy. Black soot on the doors and walls from hand prints. Cobb webbs in every single room. There was BLACK MOLD in the ceiling in the living room (which they just painted over with a completely different shade of paint, so our ceiling looked like a Picasso painting). And part of the kitchen counter was broken off. Most of the light switches were broken. A section of the cabinet in the kitchen was broken off and left a huge gaping hole. The nails in the ceiling of ecery room were coming through. And our fridge door was left open the whole night prior, after our electricity was turned on. Thanks.\n\nWhat a dream right?\n\nWell thats just the beginning of this fairytale. \n\nGod forbid if we needed to call the front office about the nuisance of a dog downstairs that barked at everythig and anything night or day. And his wonderful owner didnt train him thats its okay if the wind happens to well, blow. Oh whats that? A leaf moved?! Let me bark at it. The wind blew?! Let me bark at it. A car started?? I need to bark at it. \n\nBut if we called to complain, and if Caprice (pretty sure that was her name) answered, not only would she make you feel like absolute garbage for calling, but she wouldnt do anything about it. And if you went into the office, she would never get off of her lazy bum to help you. But Im pretty sure they decided to let her go 2 months prior to end of our lease. Atleast those final two months were alright.\n\nJust kidding.\n\nThe water in our building was shut off twice for \"repairs\". First time, there wasnt any warning. But fuck me if I need to shower before going to work right? Maybe if you had routine maintenance done on the pipes you wouldnt need to inconvenience your tenants.\n\nAnd never have I ever in the 21 years of my life here in AZ have I ever dealt with so many bugs. Ever. You want to know how to get rid of pests? Make sure the grounds are kept clean and free of debris. Want to know how to do that? A leaf blower. Mind boggling isnt it.\n\nWe had to kill about 245 earwigs during our 6 month luxury stay here. 2 scorpions. And 34 spiders. We were on the second floor mind you. We had them call their \"exterminator\" and had the place sprayed 3 times. Pretty sure the guy was spraying stuff that was watered down. And even sprayed the apartment ourselves. No luck.\n\nWhy? Because these buildings were poorly constructed and are old. There are hundreds of places for these buggers to get in. And theres nothing you can do.\n\nDo you like hearing dogs bark at all hours of the night? Well what about motorcycles and loud trucks in which the drivers need to let the world know that theyre compensating? What about loud awful music cause some turd burglar is parked outside of your window blasting music while he waits to pick up his offspring? Oh you dont?

I tried the Herb Chicken Mediterranean delite - packed with spinach, sundried tomatoes, chicken, cheese & herbs. The crust was really what made it for me, so crispy-crunchy out of the oven. \n\nI thought it was really good and most convenient, even my husband was salivating when he got home & smelled it!

A recent car purchase at Stouffville Hyundai was the smoothest, most efficient and least stressful.  The biggest contributing factor was the sales team that handled the transaction.  First and foremost, salesperson Barbara Wood arranged 2 cars for me to test drive.  She highlighted the features and differences between the 2 models during the test drive.  I stepped into the showroom expecting to receive a promotional retail rebate (per newspaper ad) and an APA rebate between Hyundai Canada, the manufacturer, and a professional association that I belong to.  She agreed to honour both rebates.  During the negotiation process, Barb helped me to negotiate a fair deal that was profitable to the dealership and would fit my budget (I changed to a lower model to accommodate my budget constraint).  Barb Wood is so knowledgeable, friendly, helpful, down-to-earth, and full of positive energy; I would buy my next car from her in a heartbeat.\n\nMy attitude going in was I just wanted a fair transaction, not to make a dealership lose money or allow myself to be ripped off.  Luckily, the sales team I dealt with was agreeable to my attitude (and that was so refreshing).  Aside from Barb, the team included Darren Doner, the General Manager, and Jim Spicer, the New Cars Sales Manager.  Darren is the coolest general manager.  He is instrumental in agreeing to the 2 rebates that I mentioned above.  Jim assisted in locating the model and colour I wanted.  He researched the whole Canada for me.  \n\nThe sales team at Stouffville Hyundai is a great team to deal with.  I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in buying a Hyundai.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

This allows you to meet the people in the house and see where the dog will be staying.    Once you find a host that works, you simply schedule the service and make the payment.

We had tried one of his restaurants in New York on loved it. We, also, loved Daniel Boulud's old resturant in Las Vegas and were sad to see it close. So when we heard he was coming back to open another restaurant, we just couldn't pass up the opportunity to try it.  This restaurant has a good mix of up-scale, as well as, casual elements.  The dinner room is large and open. The menu selection has a little for everyone ranging from artisan pasta, several classical french dishes, to burgers.  My mom tried the 3 course tasting menu and I ordered off the menu.  We started with the Thai calamari which has hints of curry and lemon grass and the pate de campagne bourguignon which came with great crusty bread, mustard and homemade pickles. Next, we had linguini de sud, which was a pasta infused with lemon and saffaron and topped with shrimp, clams, and arugula.  My mom ordered a crispy, skin on, sea bass type of fish with fingerling potatoes. And for dessert we ended with the cherry pistachio sundae topped with  butterscotch sauce and marshmellows, but next time, I have my eye on the souffle.  All the dishes where artfully presented and the staff were super helpful in suggestion. Good portion size and price!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The portion size was quite generous and was accompanied by a wedge salad.  The steak was drizzled with a red sauce, which complimented the meat perfectly.  The dressing on the wedge salad was tangy, I made sure to eat all of it.  \n\n3. Dessert - I forgot the name but it was some sort of chocolate cake with ice cream.

I think everyone who works there is amazing, happy, pleasant, cheerful. \nI've never had a bad experience and I'm so happy this place exists... \nHighly recommend the Border Benedict - Two poached eggs and seasoned carne asada on top of two sweet corn cakes, smothered in our homemade poblano sauce. Served with homefries, hashbrowns, fresh fruit, beans or Mexican rice. \nomnomnom!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}
